  "This repo's hand-authored coordination workflows and their command surface:
  the coordinator `land` workflow (family \"land\") with its `land` op, and the
  `delegate-pipeline` weave pattern for sequential delegated subagent gates.

  The devflow lifecycle itself is the external `ct.spools.devflow` spool;
  its thin CLI wrapper ops live in config.clj. This file is loaded after
  config.clj and reuses its public CLI-tail helpers (`config/pop-step-selector`
  and friends) so the `step=<id>` tail convention has one definition."

;; The encoded discipline a coordinator drives before a branch is considered

;; implemented+committed. The ordering is the enforcement: sign-off is only
;; valid on a pushed branch with a draft PR and green CI, and main is
;; branch-protected — it only moves via a mechanical `gh pr merge` with green
;; CI, never a direct push. The two CI watches and the merge continuation's
;; pull are `:shell` gates the shell executor (skein.spools.executors.shell) fulfils
;; mechanically — a red watch stamps `gate/error` on the gate for a
;; fix-push-clear retry, and `land complete` refuses gates. Human steps keep
;; `workflow/instruction` text as the enforcement surface, shipped as data.
