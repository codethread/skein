(ns nvd-scan
  "The scheduled NVD deep scan (skein.spools.cron job :nvd-scan).

  `make deps-report` runs the clj-watson NVD deep scan + govulncheck locally
  (the fast github-advisory gate stays in CI). This job runs that scan on every
  maintainer's weaver every ~6 days. Because every weaver runs it, a `scan-lock
  running` GitHub issue is a best-effort lock — an OPEN one means another
  maintainer is scanning right now — and +/-1h jitter keeps concurrent weavers
  from all firing at once. Coordination is best-effort (a double-scan is
  harmless); silent failure is not, so a missing API key or a gh/scan error
  lands loudly in `(cron/failures)`.

  Every side effect (gh, the login-shell scan, the kanban card) is injected
  into `run-nvd-scan!` so the lock flow is unit-testable without shelling out —
  see test/skein/nvd_scan_test.clj. This is its own init.clj module (not part of
  config.clj) so config_test's direct config.clj load never registers the job."
