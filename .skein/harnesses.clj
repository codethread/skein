(ns harnesses
  "Repo-local harness seats and routing policy.

  Naming convention: aliases are pure model handles (`:sol-low`,
  `:terra-med`, `:opus`) — never role names, so a seat cannot be routed by
  connotation. A `-ro` suffix marks the read-only-sandbox variant of a seat.
  Role policy lives where it is applied: reviewer rosters pick seats in
  `.skein/reviewers.clj`, workflows take seats as parameters.

  Every seat doc leads with a scorecard a coordinator can scan:

    {:complexity N :code-taste N :resilience N :ui-design N
     :coordination N :docs-prose N :cost N}

  - :complexity    hardest task it completes reliably (9 best)
  - :code-taste    repo-idiom fidelity, API design, test quality (9 best)
  - :resilience    recovery from broken/hostile environments (9 best)
  - :ui-design     interface/UX design taste (9 best)
  - :coordination  sub-supervision: seat routing, constraint tracking,
                   delegation judgment (9 best)
  - :docs-prose    human-facing documentation quality: structure,
                   transitions, factual fidelity (9 best)
  - :cost          9 is cheapest per task
  An axis of X is untested; `-` means do not route that axis's work to the
  seat at all. Pick the best-scoring seat across the axes the task actually
  needs.

  Scores are provenanced claims, never vibes: each doc names its source
  bench (or marks the axis a prior/estimate), and scores are revised only
  from new bench evidence. Current source: pandora-task-002 bench
  2026-07-13, card nihrl — 28 entries, three environment conditions;
  ui-design axes are coordinator priors (the bench had no UI signal);
  coordination axes come from the 2026-07-13 three-seat comprehension test
  (opus/terra/sol asked to derive routing policy from this registry alone)
  plus coordinator judgment; docs-prose axes come from the 2026-07-13
  two-round docs bake-off (card x6gam: three seats, identical contracts,
  isolated worktrees, adversarially reviewed drafts, user-judged).

  Docs routing policy (user decision, 2026-07-13): the :oracle docs-prose
  premium is justified only for user-facing prose — README, tutorial, user
  reference — where the writing is the product. Agent-facing docs (API
  reference, cookbooks, orientation/prime text) route to :sol-high or
  :opus, which are fully capable there at a fraction of the cost.

  Prompting note: gpt seats run well on goals and contracts alone — keep
  their prompts to objective, constraints, and Done-when. Reserve explicit
  'don't do X' guardrail lists for claude seats, which benefit from them;
  prohibition-heavy prompts on gpt seats dilute the objective (coordinator
  observation, 2026-07-13).

  Judge policy: bench judges always run on :oracle or :sol-high — never a
  cheaper seat. Verdicts drive future routing, so judge quality compounds
  and is worth the premium (user decision, 2026-07-13).

  Aliases are weaver-lifetime state, so startup config re-registers them
  like queries and ops. `strand agent harnesses` lists the live registry.
  pi seats are deprioritized for build work pending a pi-vs-codex harness
  bench (codex currently wins on RAM/CPU under concurrent load); :flash is
  the benched exception for cheap recon sweeps, and the pi harness itself
  stays registered via its spool."
