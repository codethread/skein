(ns quality.spool-var
  "The spool-var slice of quality.conventions-check: PROP-Dsp-001.G6a.

  Under the def-spool convention a public var named `spool` in a
  module-loadable namespace *is* the module declaration, always (G5's
  reservation contract). This check is the guard against incidental
  shadowing inside this repo (Q2): it rejects a public `spool` var whose
  authored value does not match the `::spool` shape — a map whose keys are
  a non-empty subset of `:contribute`/`:reconcile`, each an entry-point
  symbol (`:ns` was dropped in the rename, G2).

  It is a structural repository guard, not a second runtime contract and
  not protection for external consumers: it reads the authored literal and
  never resolves a symbol or derefs a var. The `::spool` spec in
  `skein.api.spool.alpha` and the runtime's G5 validation stay
  authoritative everywhere (G6a). Entry-point values are authored as
  quoted symbols (`'my.ns/fn`), so the read form wraps them as
  `(quote sym)`; the shape check unwraps that to recover the symbol the
  runtime will see.

  Scope is the module-loadable roots — shipped spools under
  `spools/*/src` and the workspace's `.skein` config (local spools and
  `:file` modules). Engine `src/` and `test/` namespaces are never
  activated as modules, so a `spool` var there is unaffected and out of
  scope; private `spool` vars are ignored everywhere. Kept clj-kondo-free
  so the findings logic loads on the test classpath; file reading mirrors
  the source reader surface conventions-check already scans."
