(ns quality.spool-tiers
  "The spool-tier slice of quality.conventions-check: shipped spool
  sources build on `skein.api.*.alpha`, never `skein.core.*`, and the
  designed exception is nominal — the unsafe-namespace convention of
  'Unsafe spools' in docs/spools/writing-shared-spools.md.

  A namespace is unsafe iff some segment of its name is `unsafe` or
  `unsafe-*`. Four rules, all held at zero findings over `spools/*/src`:
  `skein.core.*` is used only from unsafe-named namespaces; an
  unsafe-named namespace that touches no `skein.core.*` is stale and
  loses the name; a safe namespace never requires another spool's
  unsafe namespace (no cross-repo lockstep, so the breakage contract
  cannot be encapsulated away); and the ns docstring leads with
  `UNSAFE:` exactly when the name is unsafe. Local workspace spools
  under `.skein/spools/` are trusted config accepting the compatibility
  cost (SPEC-004.C40) and are out of scope, as are the sibling fences
  owned elsewhere: `skein.api.*.internal` by `quality.api-form`,
  `skein.userland.alpha` by `skein.userland-test`. Kept clj-kondo-free
  so the findings logic loads on the test classpath; the caller
  supplies kondo's analysis data."
