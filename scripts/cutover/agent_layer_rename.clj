(ns cutover.agent-layer-rename
  "One-shot cutover that rewrites the durable attribute keys of *active* strands
  from the pre-rename shuttle/treadle vocabulary to the agent-run/gate/review/
  panel/note vocabulary, so the canonical world matches the renamed code at the
  user-signed weaver restart (PLAN-Alr-001.PH6/TC4/CM3, PROP-Alr-001.C1).

  The mapping is the brief's cutover-contract table read row-by-row, never a
  generic prefix rule: shuttle/* run attrs split into agent-run/review/panel/note
  families per key, so a blanket shuttle/*->agent-run/* rewrite would mis-map the
  review/panel/note keys. Only shuttle/handle.<k> is a genuine dynamic-suffix
  prefix rewrite. Event-type keywords (:agent-run/engine, :gate/engine) are event
  registrations, not durable attributes, so they never appear here.

  Scope is active strands only; closed/replaced strands are historical memory,
  not authority. A key absent from the table is left in the old vocabulary by
  design. The db target must be explicit (--db, or --workspace resolved through
  `mill weaver status`); the script refuses to guess a canonical world."
