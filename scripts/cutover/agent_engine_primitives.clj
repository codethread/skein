(ns cutover.agent-engine-primitives
  "One-shot cutover that stamps the F2 agent-engine-primitives shape onto the
  *active* runs and gates of a live world, so the canonical database matches the
  rewired engine at the user-signed weaver restart (PROP-Aep-001.C12.1/C12.2,
  PLAN-Aep-001.S11/TC4). The three derivations mirror the F1 rehearse-on-a-copy
  ceremony (scripts/cutover/agent_layer_rename.clj):

  1. `serves` edges (PROP-Aep-001.C1). Serving is moving from the
     `parent-of`-plus-`agent-run/serves`-boolean overload to a single `serves`
     edge (run -> served target). For each *active* serving run this stamps that
     edge, derived from the pre-cutover heuristic — `gate/step` for a subagent
     run, else the first `parent-of` source that is not the run's `spawned-by`
     provenance. A read-only helper is a run carrying `agent-run/serves \"false\"`;
     it gets no `serves` edge. Active gates are the other authority: a gate's
     `gate/run` names its current delegated run, so `run -> gate` is stamped from
     it too (the current run's edge is derived from both sides and de-duplicated).

  2. `supersedes` lineage (PROP-Aep-001.C4/C5). Pre-cutover, the only structural
     succession link is the subagent executor's `gate/superseded-by` back-marker
     (predecessor -> successor). For each still-linked pair whose *successor* is
     active, this backfills the successor's `supersedes` edge (successor
     --supersedes--> predecessor) and its `agent-run/supersedes` attr. A plain
     `agent retry` recorded no link (bare `agent-run/phase \"superseded\"`), so
     its predecessors are orphaned closed memory — nothing to backfill.

  3. Retirement. The retired markers — `agent-run/serves` (on stamped serving
     runs only, see below), `gate/run`, `gate/step`, `gate/superseded-by`, and
     the `delegates` edge — are removed from *active* strands. `gate/run-id`
     (delivery pointer) and `gate/error`/`gate/delivered`/`gate/delivery-blocked`
     (delivery bookkeeping) are unaffected.

  Scope is active strands only (PROP-Aep-001.C12.1, C13): archived/closed strands
  are historical memory, not authority — the code wins, and the new readers are
  scoped to active work so a historical strand's old shape is never misread.
  Their retired attrs are left in place.

  A `false`-valued `agent-run/serves` boolean is deliberately *kept* on active
  helpers. The post-cutover engine never reads it, so it is inert; keeping it is
  what makes the script idempotent — with the boolean gone a helper is
  structurally indistinguishable from an unstamped serving run (both carry only
  `parent-of` placement), so a re-run would misclassify it and stamp a spurious
  `serves` edge. Serving runs, which carry no such marker, lose any
  `agent-run/serves` they had.

  Every `serves`/`supersedes` insert refuses a self-referential edge
  (PROP-Aep-001.R3): both relations are declared acyclic, so a malformed
  derivation must fail loudly on the rehearsal copy rather than corrupt
  traversal live.

  The db target must be explicit (--db, or --workspace resolved through
  `mill weaver status`); the script refuses to guess a canonical world. A live
  world's db lives under the weaver state directory, not workspace-local `data/`
  (SPEC-Aep-003).

  Run standalone (scripts/ is not on the :test alias registry):
    clojure -Sdeps '{:extra-paths [\"scripts\"]}' -M -m cutover.agent-engine-primitives \\
      --db <path>

  This script is the worker-owned rehearsal half of PROP-Aep-001.C12. The
  canonical live steps — quiet-board stamping (C12.3), the user-signed weaver
  restart (C12.4, a hard stop), and the post-cutover smoke (C12.5) — are Task 13,
  coordinator-run after explicit user sign-off. A worker never runs this against
  the canonical world."
