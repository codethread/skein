(ns cutover.note-primitive
  "One-shot HISTORY rewrite that re-keys every pre-cutover note strand with a
  live target onto the blessed `note/*` shape and the `notes` edge, so the
  canonical database matches the unified note reader at the user-signed weaver
  restart (PROP-Np-001.C10, PLAN-Np-001.S11/TC4). It mirrors the F2
  rehearse-on-a-copy ceremony (scripts/cutover/agent_engine_primitives.clj) and
  the F1 rename cutover (scripts/cutover/agent_layer_rename.clj).

  Scope is deliberately history-wide — every note strand with a live target,
  active or closed — the epic's one recorded departure from the F1/F2
  active-only rule, because the unified reader walks the `notes` relation
  regardless of state, so an un-rekeyed historical note would be invisible
  (PROP-Np-001.C10, PLAN-Np-001.CM3). Non-note history keeps its old shape.

  Two derivations, both keyed off the pre-cutover markers and both counted at
  cutover time (never hardcoded — the world accrues notes continuously,
  PROP-Np-001.R3/Q4):

  1. Shuttle-era notes with a live target (`shuttle/note-for` present, the named
     target still exists, the `notes` edge already in place from before the
     cutover): `shuttle/note` -> `note/text`, `shuttle/note-by` -> `note/by`,
     `shuttle/at` -> `note/at`; `shuttle/note-for` is dropped (the edge already
     carries linkage, PROP-Np-001.C8). The `notes` edge is left untouched.

  2. Kanban notes (`kanban/note \"true\"`) with a live card: `body` ->
     `note/text`, the `parent-of` edge (card -> note) becomes a `notes` edge
     (note -> card), `note/at` is synthesized from the strand's `created_at` and
     `note/by` from its `author` attr where present; the `kanban/note`,
     `kanban/handover`, and `kind` decorating attrs are kept.

  Notes with no live target are skipped and keep their old shape — the 67-style
  dangling shuttle notes whose target was burned (their `notes` edge cascaded
  away) and any kanban note whose card is gone (its `parent-of` cascaded away).
  They are inert closed memory, unreachable through the relation and read by
  nothing after cutover (PROP-Np-001.C11, Q4).

  Every `notes` edge insert refuses a self-referential edge (the relation is
  declared acyclic, PROP-Np-001.C1/R4): a malformed derivation must fail loudly
  on the rehearsal copy rather than corrupt a traversal live. The re-key drops
  and renames are idempotent — a re-run against a stamped world finds no
  `shuttle/note-for` on live shuttle notes and no `parent-of` on migrated kanban
  notes, so it reports a :total of 0 (PROP-Np-001.C10.1, DW1).

  The db target must be explicit (--db, or --workspace resolved through
  `mill weaver status`); the script refuses to guess a canonical world. A live
  world's db lives under the weaver state directory, not workspace-local `data/`
  (F1/F2 precedent, TASK-Aep-011.MI5).

  Run standalone (scripts/ is not on the :test alias registry):
    clojure -Sdeps '{:paths [\"scripts\"]}' -M -m cutover.note-primitive --db <path>

  This script is the worker-owned rehearsal half of PROP-Np-001.C10. The
  canonical live steps — quiet-board cutover (C10.3), the user-signed weaver
  restart under `cu3wz` (C13.2, a hard stop), and the post-cutover smoke
  (C13.3) — are Task 13, coordinator-run after explicit user sign-off. A worker
  never runs this against the canonical world."
