(ns cutover.vocab-reset
  "One-shot cutover that rewrites the durable attributes of *active* strands from
  the pre-reset vocabulary to the words the vocabulary-reset branch published, so
  a live world matches the renamed code at the user-signed weaver restart
  (SPEC-005.C11, the shared-spool vocabulary rule's cutover clause).

  Scope is active strands only: closed and replaced strands are historical
  memory, not authority, so their attributes stay exactly as they were written.
  A key absent from `migrations` is left in the old vocabulary by design.

  The migration table is data — one map per durable-attribute migration — so a
  later slice appends an entry instead of editing the engine. Three shapes:

    {:migration :rename-key   :from \"old/key\" :to \"new/key\"}
    {:migration :rename-value :key \"k\" :from \"old\" :to \"new\"}
    {:migration :drop-key     :key \"k\"}

  The table is a closed registry, and `validate-table!` is its boundary: every
  entry is checked against its variant's spec before the rewrite opens a
  transaction, so an unknown migration word, a misspelled guard key, or a
  non-string value fails naming the offending entry rather than reaching SQL
  construction. An entry carries its variant's own fields, an optional `:note`,
  and at most one value guard beside any sibling guard — nothing else.

  Each entry may narrow its rows with guards, of two readings. Value guards —
  `:when-value` / `:unless-value` / `:when-value-in` — match the row's own JSON
  value, and are what let one overloaded key split two ways: `bench/run` carries
  a root id on judge strands but a plain \"true\" marker elsewhere, and only the
  former becomes `bench/run-id`. `:when-value-in` is the enumerated form, and
  says something stronger than one half of a split: it names the whole
  vocabulary the key may carry on an active strand, so a value outside the set
  is drift rather than the other half. `kanban/status` becomes `kanban/lane`
  only for the four board lanes; an active card stamped with a finished card's
  outcome is a card the new board itself refuses to place, so the cutover
  reports it and fails rather than renaming it into a lane it never sat in.
  Sibling guards ask about the strand around the row instead: `:when-sibling`
  requires another attribute at a given value, and `:when-sibling-key` requires
  only that the strand carry a key at all.

  `:when-sibling-key` is what makes a drop safe to write down. Four of roster's
  keys are dropped rather than renamed because the entries dual-wrote a bare
  twin (`roster/owner` alongside `owner`), so the roster/* half is redundant —
  but only on a strand that really carries the twin. Guarding each drop on the
  twin's presence means the delete can never destroy the last copy of an
  identity: a strand shaped otherwise keeps its data and is reported.

  Table order matters only where an entry reads a key another entry moves: the
  plan-root `kind` rename reads `workflow` \"agent-plan\", so it is listed before
  the entry that drops that key, and the `kanban/devflow` drop reads `kanban/run`
  before the rename carries that key to `kanban/run-id` — an order that also
  keeps the two roads to `kanban/run-id` from meeting on one strand. Every other
  pair is independent.

  Idempotent by construction: each statement matches the *old* shape, so a
  re-run against a migrated world matches nothing and reports a zero total. A
  strand carrying both the old and the new key is an inconsistent world rather
  than a migrated one — the attributes primary key (strand_id, key) cannot hold
  both after the rewrite — so the pre-flight refuses it loudly instead of
  surfacing a raw SQLite constraint violation.

  Rows a guard declined are reported, in two readings the exit code keeps apart.
  A sibling guard's decline is advisory (exit 0): it says the strand was shaped
  unlike what the entry expected, which is as often correct as not, and only the
  operator can tell which — so the row is named rather than migrated blind or
  dropped in silence. A `:when-value-in` decline is drift (exit 1): the
  enumeration is a claim about the key's whole vocabulary, so the value is one
  the new code has no word for, and a run that leaves it behind is not a cutover
  any automation may read as done. A `:when-value` / `:unless-value` decline is
  not reported at all: those rows are the deliberate other half of a split,
  still spelled the way this table intends to leave them.

  Drift fails after the commit rather than aborting the transaction, because the
  drift row is no obstacle to the rewrite: it keeps its old key, which is what
  its guard chose, and every other strand migrates cleanly around it. Aborting
  would hold a whole world hostage to a judgement only a human can make about
  one card, and would abort identically on every re-run. Committing keeps both
  claims above true — the world is migrated as far as the table reaches, and a
  re-run reports a zero total and the same drift, so the exit code stays 1 until
  the operator resolves the row itself.

  The db target must be explicit (--db, or --workspace resolved through
  `mill weaver status`); the script refuses to guess a canonical world. A live
  world's db lives under the weaver state directory, not workspace-local
  `data/`.

  Run it with scripts/ on the classpath:
    clojure -Sdeps '{:extra-paths [\"scripts\"]}' -M -m cutover.vocab-reset \\
      --db <path>

  WHEN: once per world, at merge/reload time, by the user — not by an agent and
  not against a world an agent owns. The canonical `.skein` world is migrated as
  a hand step: land the branch, stop the weaver, run this against the world's db,
  then start the weaver again on the renamed code. Rehearse on a copy of the db
  first: the rewrite is one transaction, so an *aborted* run leaves the world as
  it was, but a drift failure commits — the copy is where you find out which
  strands you will have to resolve by hand before the real one."
