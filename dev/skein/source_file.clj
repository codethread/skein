  Workspace startup files (init.clj, generated spool and namespace sources)
  exercised by tests are authored as quoted forms, not hand-concatenated
  strings, so the reader checks their syntax when the authoring file compiles
  and the conventions gate can resolve requires embedded in quoted data.
  Keep require forms plain-quoted: syntax-quote reads into seq/concat calls
  the gate's quoted-data walker cannot see. Use syntax-quote only on forms
  that interpolate runtime values, escaping local binding names as ~'sym."

  elements as its own top-level form. Binds *print-length* and
