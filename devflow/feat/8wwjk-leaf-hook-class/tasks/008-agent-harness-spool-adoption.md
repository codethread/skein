# Task 8: agent-harness.spool adoption (agent-run/delegation/bench) + release tag

**Document ID:** `TASK-Lhc-008`

## TASK-Lhc-008.P1 Scope

Type: AFK

Adopt per-leaf classes across all three roots of
`~/dev/projects/agent-harness.spool` (pinned v11 in skein-src): `agent-run`,
`delegation` (the `agent` op family), and `bench`. The motivating fix: `agent`
today registers op-wide `:deadline-class :unbounded` for the sake of its
awaiting verbs — under leaf classes, only the blocking leaves (`await`,
`flow-await`-style verbs, interactive attach) declare `:unbounded`; every other
verb gets its true class. Do not trust this task's prose for the verb
inventory: derive the exact leaf list per root from the pinned v11 source
(review confirmed there is no `attach` leaf) and produce a full verb-by-verb
class matrix in the worklog before editing.

## TASK-Lhc-008.P2 Must implement exactly

- **TASK-Lhc-008.MI1:** Every op leaf in all three roots declares both classes
  in its arg-spec; no registration-opts classes remain; doc-only leaves
  included.
- **TASK-Lhc-008.MI2:** Handler `:subcommand` consumption updated to path
  vectors. Enumerate every positional-action grammar in the migration matrix;
  any grammar relying on the retired nested `:action` label amendment MUST
  migrate to real nesting here (DELTA-Lhc-002.CC5); purely-internal positionals
  that never fed the label may stay, marked so in the matrix.
- **TASK-Lhc-008.MI3:** Root docs/contracts updated (`strand about agent`
  prose source, bench manual) where they state op-wide classes.
- **TASK-Lhc-008.MI4:** All three roots' suites green against the feature
  checkout.
- **TASK-Lhc-008.MI5:** Release + wiring discipline:
- **WIRE:** Work in a clean isolated worktree of the spool repo (never the
  user's live checkout); the repo's deps hard-code `../skein-src`, so wire the
  feature checkout with an **uncommitted** local dev override (deps.edn
  `:local/root` override or the repo's documented mechanism) pointing at
  `/Users/ct/dev/projects/skein-src__8wwjk-leaf-hook-class`; prove no override
  lands in any commit (`git show --stat` in worklog).
- **CEREMONY:** Run the repo's `bin/compat-alarm` (or documented equivalent)
  against the previous tag, decide/record the Skein version floor, push commits
  to the default branch, push the annotated tag, and record the tag plus the
  peeled `refs/tags/vN^{}` commit SHA in the worklog note.


## TASK-Lhc-008.P3 Done when

- **TASK-Lhc-008.DW1:** All three roots' suites cold-green against the feature
  checkout; repo gates green.
- **TASK-Lhc-008.DW2:** `v12` annotated tag pushed; worklog carries tag +
  peeled SHA + compat-alarm outcome + class matrices.

## TASK-Lhc-008.P4 Out of scope

- **TASK-Lhc-008.OS1:** Any skein-src edit; other spool repos.
