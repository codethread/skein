# 8wwjk-leaf-hook-class plan

**Document ID:** `PLAN-Lhc-001`
**Status:** Reviewed
**Last Updated:** 2026-07-22

## PLAN-Lhc-001.P1 Goal and scope

Ship DELTA-Lhc-001/002/003: mandatory per-leaf `:hook-class`/`:deadline-class`,
arity-N fractal subcommands, leaf-resolving hook gate and deadlines, per-node help
classes, and the full owned-surface sweep (in-repo ops, publication-seam
constructors, sibling spools with pin bumps). Breaking, one queue, no migration.

## PLAN-Lhc-001.P2 Approach

One **design thin-slice first** (oracle seat): implement the fractal mechanism
end-to-end — recursive structural validation with leaf-class rules, recursive
parse routing with path-vector results, returns mirror-recursion, leaf-resolving
socket gate and deadline lookup, per-node help projection with the schema-version
bump — and apply it to exactly **one** op surface (batteries `spool`, folding
`spool-status` in as a `status` read verb) plus a synthetic depth-3 grammar in the
test namespace. The slice proves composition and the public contracts; it may
amend the deltas only with evidence from the applied seam. Everything after it is
mechanical and fans out to terra-med seats in file-disjoint slices, with sol-med
as the standing cross-vendor reviewer for the oracle-authored slice.

Enforcement cannot flip before the sweep: runtime startup registers the
`help`/`about`/`prime` builtins and publishes every batteries entry, so a
validator that requires leaf classes on day one fails every boot and no phase
gate can stay green. The queue therefore stages **mechanism first, flip after
the sweep**: PH1 lands recursion + leaf-class support *accretively* (new shape
accepted and preferred; old op-level classes and defaults still tolerated as
intra-branch scaffolding), PH2 sweeps every in-repo registrant onto the new
shape with green gates throughout, and PH3 is the **enforcement flip** — delete
the defaults and the op-level tolerance, forbid non-leaf classes — landing
atomically with nothing left to break in-repo. The scaffolding never ships as a
contract: it exists only between PH1 and PH3 on this branch, and the flip is a
Done-when gate of the queue, not an option. Sibling spools adopt post-flip
against this checkout; `spool-suite-gate` is expected red from PH3 until the
last pin bump, and green at acceptance.

## PLAN-Lhc-001.P3 Affected areas

- `skein.api.cli` (`alpha`, `internal/validation`, `internal/help`): recursive
  validator, parse, explain; leaf-class node metadata; reserved names per level.
- `skein.api.weaver.internal.op-entry` + `skein.api.return-shape.alpha`: mandatory
  leaf classes, no defaults, returns mirror-recursion, alignment checks.
- `skein.core.weaver.socket`: leaf-resolving payload-hook gate and deadline
  default; pre-hook loud unknown/missing-verb failures.
- `skein.core.weaver.help`: node-key classes with per-kind null semantics,
  verb-path slicing, catalog rule, schema-version bump; `skein.core.weaver.core-registry`:
  publication entry validation seam.
- `skein.api.weaver.alpha`: dispatch label from path vector (retire the `:action`
  special-case); recursive annotation/glossary collection.
- `skein.test.alpha`: path-aware return selection; synthetic depth-N fixtures.
- In-repo registrants: batteries (all ops + reference renderer), `help` builtin,
  guild, text-search, `.skein/config.clj` ops, `.skein/workflows.clj`,
  `.skein/spools/macros` `defop`, test fixtures, smoke suite.
- Sibling spool repos (released by annotated tag, pinned in `.skein/spools.edn`):
  `kanban.spool` (codethread/kanban, v6), `devflow.spool` (codethread/devflow,
  v3), `agent-harness.spool` (ct.spools/agent-run, v11 — roots agent-run,
  delegation, bench). In-repo local spools (workflow, text-search, chime, cron,
  macros) belong to the in-repo sweep, not the fan-out.
- Docs: root specs (delta promotion), `docs/reference.md`, spool authoring guide
  CLI-style section, generated `*.api.md`.
- Go CLI: verification only (pre-op help alias vs deeper paths); no code changes
  expected.

## PLAN-Lhc-001.P4 Implementation phases

- **PLAN-Lhc-001.PH1 (design slice — oracle):** Accretive mechanism end-to-end
  (recursive validator/parse/explain, node classes preferred with op-level
  tolerance, returns mirror-recursion, leaf-resolving gate/deadline with
  fallback, per-node help keys, canonical error context) + the one applied op
  (batteries `spool` + `status` fold-in per DELTA-Lhc-001.CC8) + a synthetic
  depth-3 fixture + focused cold tests. Deltas amended only with evidence from
  the applied seam. Cross-vendor review (sol-med) gates the phase. Task manifest
  names its exact source/test files; PH2 slices may not touch them.
- **PLAN-Lhc-001.PH2 (in-repo sweep — terra-med, file-disjoint parallel):**
  (a) batteries remaining ops + reference renderer + owner tests +
  `spools/batteries.md`/`spools/README.md`; (b) system ops `help`/`about`/`prime`
  (one registrar), guild, text-search, publication constructors, smoke;
  (c) `.skein` config ops, `workflows.clj`, `defop` macro, test fixtures. Task
  files carry exact file manifests and the positional-action migration matrix
  (which grammars fold to real verbs, which stay positionals). Cold focused
  suites green per slice.
- **PLAN-Lhc-001.PH3 (enforcement flip — oracle or sol-med, single atomic
  slice):** Delete defaults and op-level class tolerance; forbid non-leaf
  classes and class keys beside an arg-spec; publication-seam validation goes
  strict (canonical validator + glossary at reconcile). In-repo suites + smoke
  green at the end of this slice; `spool-suite-gate` goes red here by design.
- **PLAN-Lhc-001.PH4 (specs + docs — terra-med):** Promote deltas into root
  specs, sweep `docs/reference.md` + authoring guide CLI-style section,
  regenerate api docs, `make docs-check` green.
- **PLAN-Lhc-001.PH5 (sibling spool fan-out — terra-med, one seat per repo):**
  Per spool: adopt leaf classes (and real nesting where grammars used positional
  actions — kanban `task` is the known case; each spool task enumerates its own
  matrix), suite green against the feature checkout, annotated release tag
  pushed. The pin bump in skein-src is a single coordinator-sequenced task after
  all releases exist.
- **PLAN-Lhc-001.PH6 (acceptance):** Full locked suite under the flock, Go tests,
  smoke, `spool-suite-gate` green again, quality gates at zero; land via the
  coordinator landing workflow.

## PLAN-Lhc-001.P5 Validation strategy

Per-slice: cold `clojure -M:test <owned namespaces>`. Phase gates: PH1 adds
socket-level integration coverage for pre-hook verb failures and read-leaf hook
skipping; PH2 keeps smoke green under the accretive mechanism; PH3 re-proves
suites + smoke post-flip and is the phase where registration-failure coverage
(missing leaf class, class beside arg-spec, interior class, empty subcommands)
becomes assertive; PH5 runs each spool's own suite against this checkout.
Acceptance: full locked suite, `(cd cli && go test ./...)`, `clojure -M:smoke`,
`make spool-suite-gate`, `make fmt-check lint reflect-check docs-check`, clean
`git status --short`. Disposable workspaces for every runtime experiment; the
canonical `.skein` world is never touched by tests.

## PLAN-Lhc-001.P6 Task context

Workers receive: the three deltas as the binding contract; the decision notes
(`77xab` supersedes `mnl04`); TEN-000@1/TEN-003 as the license for breaking, loud
changes; the file-ownership boundaries above (sibling tasks never share files);
and the rule that warm-REPL output satisfies no gate. Sibling-spool workers work
in their spool's own repo checkout and must not touch skein-src beside the pin
bump task, which is coordinator-sequenced after all spool releases exist.

## PLAN-Lhc-001.P7 Developer Notes

- 2026-07-22 (coordinator): task-queue review runs xogz3+6qg5z (notes 64ses,
  qpf5g on strand kx90q) folded: devflow.spool dropped from the fan-out (v3
  registers no CLI ops — pin stays v3); workflow/chime/cron register no CLI
  ops; smoke owned by Task 1; guild constructor API requires caller-supplied
  classes; test-registration sweep enumerated (Task 4 + Task 5 backstop);
  :action-label grammars must migrate in-queue; sibling tasks get wiring +
  compat-alarm ceremony; api-docs regenerated per task; queue renumbered to 9
  tasks while still draft.
- 2026-07-22 (coordinator): spec/plan review runs szlo1+nz2x6 (notes n59mo, mzijt
  on strand exuix) folded: single-source class authoring, doc-only leaves, C63a/b
  + C33 + C63b-deadline amendments, deep help-alias semantics, canonical error
  context, publication validator/glossary seam, accretive-then-flip phase order,
  about/prime registrar, catalog wording. Plan set Reviewed.
- 2026-07-22 (coordinator): proposal review e8zr7 findings folded; note the
  publication seam (`core-registry` entry spec is `map?` today) is a required
  enforcement point, not an optional hardening.
- Live-weaver caution: the canonical weaver keeps running pre-change code until
  the user-sanctioned restart/refresh after landing; `.skein` config edits on
  this branch are inert until merged. Never refresh or restart the canonical
  weaver from this feature's tasks.
