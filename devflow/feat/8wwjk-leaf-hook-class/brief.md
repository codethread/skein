# Brief: mandatory per-leaf hook-class + arity-N fractal subcommands (8wwjk)

Card 8wwjk. User decision 2026-07-22 (design session; decision notes mnl04 then 77xab,
which supersedes mnl04 and the card's original convention+lint framing entirely).

## Problem

`:hook-class` is declared per **op**, never per subcommand, so mixed ops are
misclassified wholesale: `kanban` registers `:mutating` while `board`/`about`/`card`
are pure reads; `agent` registers an unbounded deadline for one awaiting verb; the
`spool` op exiles its reads to a separate `spool-status` op just to escape mutation
gating. The `:mutating` default on registration violates TEN-003: reads are only
read-class where a registrant remembered to declare it, and the default is
re-created outside `register-op!` by the module-publication path and the `defop`
macro. Separately, SPEC-003.C64 caps subcommands at one level — a v1 scope cut
with no technical constraint behind it (audit 2026-07-22, sharpened by review
e8zr7: no blocker, but the one-level assumption is encoded at several seams the
proposal's scope enumerates; the Go CLI needs no changes — post-op argv is opaque
to it, with only its pre-op help alias to verify against deeper paths).

## Decision

Breaking change under TEN-000@1 (alpha; no migration) enforced loudly at
registration per TEN-003 — runtime structural validation, **not** convention+lint,
superseding the card's original framing. We own every consumer: in-repo surface
plus sibling spools, all swept in the same queue.

1. **`:hook-class` is a mandatory leaf-node fact.** Every subcommand leaf declares
   it in its arg-spec node (peer of `:doc`/`:flags`/`:positionals`). Flat and
   raw-envelope ops are their own leaf: `:hook-class` becomes required at
   registration and the `:mutating` default is deleted. Missing declaration fails
   loudly at `register-op!`/`replace-op!`.
2. **Forbidden anywhere non-leaf.** Interior nodes and the op root of a subcommand
   op may not declare it — interior nodes are never invocable. No op-wide
   hook-class exists at all: not declared, not derived, removed from the help
   envelope's op-wide facts and rendered per leaf node instead.
3. **Gate walks to the leaf.** The socket resolves the invoked leaf by walking argv
   tokens; a missing or unknown verb at any depth fails loudly **before** payload
   hooks, extending SPEC-004.C80's unknown-op-pre-hook precedent. No fallback
   class: nothing invocable resolves to a non-leaf.
4. **Arity-N fractal subcommands.** Lift the C64 one-level cap. The node shape is
   uniform at every depth (`:doc :flags :positionals :annotations :hook-class
   :deadline-class [:subcommands]`), so verb blocks compose in one large form, in
   flat `def`ed blocks, or as reused patterns — plain data, no new DSL. The
   reserved `:subcommand` result key becomes the full path. Returns `:subcommands`
   routing mirror-recurses. Reserved names (`help`/`-h`/`--help`, `subcommand`)
   apply at every level; error contexts carry the node path.
5. **`:deadline-class` rides identical rules** (mandatory leaf, forbidden interior,
   per-leaf socket enforcement).

## Scope

- Core: `skein.api.cli` (validator recursion, parse routing, explain),
  `skein.api.weaver.internal.op-entry` (mandatory leaf classes, no default,
  returns mirror-recursion), `skein.core.weaver.socket` (leaf-resolving gate),
  `skein.core.weaver.help` (per-node class rendering, verb-path envelope walk).
- Specs: SPEC-003.C64/C65/C66/C68, SPEC-004.C63a/C80, SPEC-002.C44.
- Sweep: batteries, `help` builtin, `.skein/config.clj` ops, and sibling spools
  (kanban, delegation, bench, agent-harness, workflow) — every leaf audited and
  declared; `spool-status`-style split read ops fold back in as verbs where it
  reads better; spool pins bump in the same queue (spool-suite-gate is expected
  red mid-queue, green at acceptance).
- Go CLI: no changes.

## Shape of the work

One thin slice first (oracle seat): the fractal arity-N node design — validator,
parse recursion, `:subcommand` path shape — applied in exactly one place to prove
composition. Then the mechanical fan-out (terra-med seats): leaf declarations
everywhere, gate/help/spec updates, sibling spool sweeps and pin ceremony.
Cross-vendor review per roster policy (sol-med reviews claude-authored work).
