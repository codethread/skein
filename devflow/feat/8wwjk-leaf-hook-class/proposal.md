## PROP-Lhc-001.P1 Problem

`:hook-class` and `:deadline-class` are declared per **op**, so mixed multi-verb ops
are classified wholesale: `kanban` registers `:mutating` while `board`/`about`/`card`
are pure reads (mutation-gating read-only and offline projections); `agent` registers
an unbounded deadline for one awaiting verb; `spool` exiles its reads to a separate
`spool-status` op solely to escape the op-wide class. The registration-time
`:mutating` default is a sensible-default violation of TEN-003: today's read ops
are read-class only because each registrant remembered to declare it (batteries
declares its reads explicitly), and the default is re-created independently
outside `register-op!` by the module-publication path (whose entry spec validates
only `map?`) and the workspace `defop` macro — so the misclassification hazard is
structural, not hypothetical. Independently, SPEC-003.C64 caps subcommands at one
level; the cap was a v1 scope cut with no technical constraint behind it
(2026-07-22 audit, sharpened by proposal review e8zr7: no blocker exists, but the
one-level assumption is encoded at several seams — the validator guard, the parse
pipeline's flat-only switch after the first token, terminal first-level returns
alignment, the one-verb help-path cap, and the dispatch label's positional
special-case — each of which generalizes mechanically; scope enumerates them).
The cap forces nested verb grammars into positional-action hacks
(`kanban task <action> …`). The Go CLI needs no changes: post-op argv is opaque
to it; its one pre-op behavior (the help alias) is verified against deeper paths
in the sweep.

## PROP-Lhc-001.P2 Goals

- **PROP-Lhc-001.G1:** Every invocable leaf (subcommand leaf; flat or raw-envelope
  op) carries an explicit, mandatory `:hook-class` and `:deadline-class`; missing or
  misplaced declarations fail loudly at registration (TEN-003).
- **PROP-Lhc-001.G2:** No op-wide class exists for subcommand ops — not declared,
  not derived; consumers (payload-hook gate, help, deadline resolution) resolve from
  the invoked leaf only.
- **PROP-Lhc-001.G3:** Subcommands nest to arbitrary depth with one uniform fractal
  node shape at every level, so verb blocks compose as plain data (single form, flat
  `def`s, or reused patterns) with no new DSL.
- **PROP-Lhc-001.G4:** A missing or unknown verb at any depth fails loudly before
  payload hooks run, extending the SPEC-004.C80 unknown-op precedent.
- **PROP-Lhc-001.G5:** The whole owned surface adopts in one queue: in-repo ops,
  the `help` builtin, `.skein` config ops, and all sibling spools (kanban,
  delegation, bench, agent-harness, workflow) with their pin-bump ceremony.

## PROP-Lhc-001.P3 Non-goals

- **PROP-Lhc-001.NG1:** No compatibility shims, migrations, derivation fallbacks, or
  defaults — breaking under TEN-000@1; we own every consumer.
- **PROP-Lhc-001.NG2:** No richer semantic-class taxonomy (create/transition/
  host-effect …) beyond `:hook-class` `:read|:mutating` and `:deadline-class`
  `:standard|:unbounded`; a finer taxonomy is future accretion.
- **PROP-Lhc-001.NG3:** No Go CLI changes; `strand` stays a pure argv forwarder.
- **PROP-Lhc-001.NG4:** No lint-only enforcement: the contract is registration-time
  structural validation. `lint-conventions` may additionally catch it pre-load, but
  the runtime check is the contract.

## PROP-Lhc-001.P4 Proposed scope

- **PROP-Lhc-001.S1:** Arg-spec nodes gain `:hook-class`/`:deadline-class` as
  leaf-only, mandatory metadata — single-sourced: any op with an arg-spec authors
  classes only in its leaf nodes (a flat root is its leaf), and registration opts
  carrying class keys beside an arg-spec fail loudly; raw-envelope ops (no
  arg-spec) declare both in registration opts. Interior-node declarations fail
  loudly. The `:mutating`/implicit defaults are deleted. An empty `:subcommands {}` map is
  invalid (an op must have at least one invocable leaf). A streaming leaf must
  declare `:deadline-class :unbounded` — streams stay explicitly unbounded; no new
  streaming-timeout machinery is introduced.
- **PROP-Lhc-001.S2:** The one-level `:subcommands` cap is lifted everywhere the
  assumption is encoded: the structural validator's nesting guard, the parse
  pipeline (first-token recursion with reserved names per level), returns
  `:subcommands` mirror-routing including the return-shape validator's nested-case
  rejection and the terminal first-level alignment check, annotation/glossary
  collection (today one level deep — deeper `failure-modes` must not evade
  registration validation), the one-verb help-path cap, the test helper's
  scalar-subcommand return selector, and the dispatch label's positional
  special-case. The reserved `:subcommand` result key carries the full path;
  error contexts carry the node path.
- **PROP-Lhc-001.S3:** The socket payload-hook gate and deadline resolution resolve
  from the invoked leaf; unresolvable verbs fail loudly pre-hook. Enforcement
  covers **every registration route**, not just `register-op!`: the
  module-publication entry seam (today validated only as `map?`) gains the same
  leaf-class structural validation, and hand-assembled entry constructors (guild,
  text-search, workspace `workflows.clj`, the `defop` macro, test fixtures) are
  swept onto it.
- **PROP-Lhc-001.S4:** Help renders classes per node with defined semantics for
  every node kind — leaf, interior, raw-envelope root, verb-sliced node, and
  catalog summary — and op-wide `hook-class`/`deadline-class` leave the envelope's
  operation facts (help `schema-version` bumps). Downstream renderers of op-wide
  classes (the batteries reference renderer) update with it.
- **PROP-Lhc-001.S5:** Root specs SPEC-003.C64/C65/C66/C68 plus the recursion-
  and registration-adjacent clauses SPEC-003.C28/C60b/C67, SPEC-004.C63a/C63b/
  C63d/C80/C108, and SPEC-002.C44 are updated via feature-local deltas; the owned
  op surface and all sibling spools adopt in the same queue, folding split read
  ops (`spool-status`) back in as verbs where the surface reads better.

## PROP-Lhc-001.P5 Open questions

- **PROP-Lhc-001.Q1:** Exact shape of the `:subcommand` path value (vector of
  tokens vs joined string) and of path-carrying error contexts — owned by the
  design thin-slice (the first implementation task); its outcome is recorded in
  the feature spec deltas before the mechanical fan-out begins.
