# daemon-runtime delta for 8wwjk-leaf-hook-class

**Document ID:** `DELTA-Lhc-002`
**Root spec:** [daemon-runtime.md](../../../specs/daemon-runtime.md)
**Feature:** [../proposal.md](../proposal.md)
**Status:** Draft
**Last Updated:** 2026-07-22

## DELTA-Lhc-002.P1 Summary

Registration requires explicit leaf classes on every route into the registry, the
payload-hook gate and deadline resolution resolve from the invoked leaf, and
unresolvable verbs fail loudly before hooks. Breaking under TEN-000@1.

## DELTA-Lhc-002.P2 Contract changes

- **DELTA-Lhc-002.CC1 (amends SPEC-004.C63a):** The op metadata map loses its
  `:hook-class`/`:deadline-class` defaults, and the authoring rule is single-
  source: an op that declares an `:arg-spec` authors classes **only** in the
  arg-spec's leaf nodes (a flat arg-spec root is its leaf — DELTA-Lhc-001.CC2),
  and registration opts carrying either class key alongside an arg-spec fail
  loudly. A **raw-envelope** op (no arg-spec) **must** declare both class keys in
  registration opts — the only shape that authors them there. Violations fail
  loudly at `register-op!`/`replace-op!` naming the op and, for node-level
  violations, the canonical DELTA-Lhc-001.CC3 error context.
- **DELTA-Lhc-002.CC2 (amends SPEC-004.C63d, closes the publication seam):** One
  **canonical entry validator** — owned by the op-entry module, the same
  structural/class/recursion/returns checks `register-op!` runs — validates
  entries on **every** route before they become effective: direct registration,
  and module publication at generation reconcile (glossary-ref checks per
  DELTA-Lhc-001.CC5). The core registry's storage-side entry spec stays thin
  (storage is not the validation tier); publication invokes the canonical
  validator from the publishing side. Hand-assembled entry constructors —
  batteries' contribution path, guild, text-search, workspace `workflows.clj`,
  the workspace `defop` macro, and test fixtures — conform by construction;
  none may re-create a class default.
- **DELTA-Lhc-002.CC3 (amends SPEC-004.C80):** `:payload/received` hooks gate
  socket `invoke` by the **invoked leaf's** `:hook-class`: the gate walks the
  envelope argv tokens through the op's arg-spec to the leaf before running
  hooks. `:read` leaves skip payload hooks; `:mutating` leaves run them. A
  missing or unknown verb token at any depth fails loudly **before any hook
  runs** — the same pre-hook policy as an unknown op name — carrying the op, the
  path walked, and the available children. Flat and raw-envelope ops gate on
  their own (mandatory) class; nothing defaults.
- **DELTA-Lhc-002.CC4 (amends SPEC-004.C26b and C63b's deadline sentence):** The
  single-result deadline default comes from the **invoked leaf's**
  `:deadline-class`; envelope `timeout` still overrides. C63b's "such ops must
  register `:deadline-class :unbounded`" reads at leaf granularity: the
  **blocking leaf** declares `:unbounded`, and sibling verbs keep their own
  classes. Stream-class ops remain unbounded, consistent with the leaf-level
  `:unbounded` requirement (DELTA-Lhc-001.CC2).
- **DELTA-Lhc-002.CC5 (amends SPEC-004.C63b):** The dispatch-owned `:operation`
  label amendment derives from the parsed `:subcommand` **path vector** joined
  with spaces. The "parsed nested `:action`" special-case is retired: grammars
  that encoded verbs as positionals migrate to real nested subcommands.
- **DELTA-Lhc-002.CC6 (amends SPEC-004.C108):** The trailing `--help`/`-h` flag
  rewrite keeps its C108 trigger (final token, no other flags, no payloads) and
  rewrites `strand <op> <tokens...> --help` to `help <op> <tokens...>` for all op
  shapes, still resolving before hook gating as a read-class registry
  projection. The rewritten help resolves `<tokens...>` as a node path per
  DELTA-Lhc-001.CC6 — interior and leaf nodes are both valid targets — and a
  token that names no child fails loudly in help with the canonical error
  context (so `spool add <url> --help` fails naming `add`'s children as none,
  never silently parsing). The retired-sugar redirect and its
  declared-subcommand exemption evaluate against the first-level child names as
  today; reserved-name validation at every depth (DELTA-Lhc-001.CC1) keeps
  `help` undeclarable anywhere.

## DELTA-Lhc-002.P3 Design decisions

### DELTA-Lhc-002.D1 Pre-hook loud failure instead of a fallback class

- **Decision:** No class exists for "the op as a whole"; unresolvable invocations
  fail loudly before payload hooks.
- **Rationale:** Nothing invocable resolves to a non-leaf (a verb-less invocation
  of a subcommand op is already a loud parse error), and SPEC-004.C80 already
  fails unknown ops pre-hook — this extends that policy down the tree rather
  than inventing a conservative gating class that would never gate a successful
  invocation.
- **Rejected:** Gating unresolvable invocations with a derived superclass (dead
  path — the invocation fails at parse regardless; running mutation hooks for a
  doomed request only adds noise).

## DELTA-Lhc-002.P4 Open questions

- None.
