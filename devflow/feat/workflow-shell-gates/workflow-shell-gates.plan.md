## PLAN-ShellGates-001.P1 Goal and scope

Ship a mechanical, durable, re-runnable check of a workflow *artifact* — a machine
done-signal independent of run exit status — by adding a `:shell` gate waiter and a
classpath executor spool that fulfils it (proposal `G1`–`G4`). The workflow engine
does not change: the executor is a treadle sibling that knows both the workflow gate
vocabulary and process execution, and closes the gate through the ordinary
`workflow/complete!` surface.

Resolved decisions binding this plan:

- **PLAN-ShellGates-001.D1 (spool name — resolves `PROP-ShellGates-001.Q1`):** the
  spool is **`skein.spools.reed`** — the loom reed beats each pick (weft) into a
  consistent, checked position, i.e. the mechanical enforcer of the fabric, matching
  the treadle/shuttle/selvage/carder house naming. Source lives at
  `spools/src/skein/spools/reed.clj` (classpath tier, a sibling of `loom`/`workflow`,
  **not** an approved local root). Contract doc `spools/reed.md`. Every proposal
  reference to the working name `skein.spools.shell-gate` / `spools/shell-gate.md`
  reads as `reed` / `spools/reed.md`.
- **PLAN-ShellGates-001.D2:** the whole design is fixed by `PROP-ShellGates-001`:
  `:shell` waiter; classpath executor spool; direct process execution (no shuttle);
  loud distinct `shell/error` state; bounded output on gate attributes; argv from
  trusted definition code with params supplying data only; no implicit shell; no
  `:ci` family; the treadle/`sh` collision fix stays out of scope.

In scope: the `reed` spool and its `shell/*` gate vocabulary; the `:shell` executor
registration + stall predicate + `stalled-shell-gates` query; the contract-doc triad;
the doc-index/spec-index updates; optional live activation in this repo's `.skein`;
the tested behaviour contract.

Out of scope (proposal non-goals, carried verbatim): option B / `workflow/validate`
close-time hook (`NG1`); a `:ci` waiter or general external-check family (`NG2`); a
named-command argv registry (`NG3`); implicit shell wrapping (`NG4`); unbounded output
capture / the `<gate-id>.shell.log` file escape hatch (`NG5`); the treadle/`sh`
preamble collision fix and blessing `sh` `:subagent` gates (`NG6`). The pattern-layer
restoration of the agent-plan `validation` ergonomic (a trailing `:shell` gate per
task) is an explicit follow-up, not this feature (`NG1`, proposal §Rejected B).

## PLAN-ShellGates-001.P2 Approach

The executor is a direct treadle analogue (`spools/shuttle/src/skein/spools/treadle.clj`
is the reference implementation), minus everything shuttle-specific.

- **PLAN-ShellGates-001.A1 (event-driven + scan reconciliation):** `install!`
  registers one weaver event handler on the graph-mutation event types
  (`:strand/added :strand/updated :batch/applied :strand/burned :strand/superseded`,
  matching treadle's `event-types`) whose handler runs a `scan!`. `scan!` enumerates
  ready `:shell` gates purely through the workflow surface —
  `(workflow/active-runs)` → `(workflow/next-steps run-id)` filtered to
  `(= "shell" (:gate step))` — so the executor never reaches into engine internals.
  A cold `install!` runs one initial scan (treadle precedent), and `scan!` serializes
  on a runtime-owned monitor so independent weaver runtimes in one JVM never block
  each other.
- **PLAN-ShellGates-001.A2 (runtime-owned state, no module-level atoms):** all state
  lives under `skein.api.runtime.alpha/spool-state` keyed by the spool (treadle's
  `new-state`/`state`/`state-version` idiom, TEN — no module-level atoms). The state
  holds the scan monitor **and** a spool-owned worker `ExecutorService` on which
  processes actually run. The worker pool is created lazily in `new-state` and shut
  down on runtime stop (mirror shuttle's scheduler lifecycle; register a runtime-stop
  hook so the pool does not outlive the world). Bump `state-version` if the state key
  set ever changes, and keep a `state-shape-matches-declared-version` test as treadle
  does — spool-state survives `reload!`.
- **PLAN-ShellGates-001.A3 (process execution OFF the weaver event thread):** the
  event handler must return promptly. When `scan!` finds a ready, un-run, un-errored
  `:shell` gate it **claims** it idempotently (stamp a `shell/running` / claim marker
  before dispatch so a concurrent scan or sibling executor does not double-launch —
  treadle claims via `treadle/run` + a `delegates` edge; reed's claim is a single
  attribute since there is no separate run strand), then submits the actual
  `ProcessBuilder` execution to the worker pool. The event thread never blocks on a
  child process. On completion the worker thread stamps the outcome and, on pass,
  calls `workflow/complete!` — the same graph-mutation path treadle takes off its own
  async work.
- **PLAN-ShellGates-001.A4 (`shell/*` gate attribute contract):** all plain JSON
  `TEXT` on the gate strand. Inputs are authored in the trusted workflow definition;
  pour-time params supply only data elements the definition interpolates
  (`PROP-ShellGates-001.NG3`).

  | Attribute | On | Required | Meaning |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | `shell/argv` | gate (input) | **yes** | JSON array of strings, executed directly with **no** implicit shell. Missing / blank / non-array / non-string-element fails loudly onto `shell/error`, spawning no process (`NG4`, TEN-003). An author wanting shell features writes `["sh" "-c" "…"]` explicitly. |
  | `shell/cwd` | gate (input) | no | Working directory for the process. Absent → the weaver's default working directory. |
  | `shell/timeout-secs` | gate (input) | no | Wall-clock bound; on expiry the process is killed and `shell/error` is stamped. A non-positive / non-integer value fails loudly onto `shell/error` (TEN-003, do not silently clamp). |
  | `shell/exit-code` | gate (recorded) | — | Process exit code, recorded on **both** outcomes (pass and fail). Absent on spawn error / invalid argv (no process ran). |
  | `shell/output` | gate (recorded) | — | Bounded stdout+stderr **tail** (last N KB, one fixed bound), for audit. Bounded on purpose (`NG5`; large attribute payloads are a known cost per the attr-scaling work). |
  | `shell/error` | gate (recorded) | — | Durable failure detail (non-zero exit, timeout, spawn error, or invalid argv). Its presence makes the gate a coordinator-visible stalled state and causes reed to **skip** the gate on later scans until cleared. |

  The **pass** outcome rides the ordinary workflow vocabulary only: reed closes the
  gate with `workflow/complete!` `:by "shell"` and `:notes` = a short result summary
  (surfacing as `workflow/outcome-by "shell"` / `workflow/notes`, mirroring treadle
  putting `shuttle/result` in `workflow/notes`). **No new `workflow/*` attribute is
  introduced** (`PROP-ShellGates-001.S3`).
- **PLAN-ShellGates-001.A5 (loud, distinct failure — `G3`/`S4`):** a failed check does
  **not** close the gate and does **not** masquerade as a failed shuttle run. reed
  stamps `shell/error` (with `shell/exit-code` and bounded `shell/output` where a
  process ran) and leaves the gate **ready and stamped** — a signal unmistakably
  distinct from treadle's dead-delegated-run failure, because it lives on the gate as
  a shell error rather than as a failed run strand.
- **PLAN-ShellGates-001.A6 (deterministic skip + clear-to-retry recovery — `S4`):**
  because the check is deterministic, a gate stamped `shell/error` (or with a live
  claim marker) is **skipped** on every later scan until a coordinator clears the
  stamp — an expensive `make test` runs once per deliberate request, not on every
  graph mutation, exactly as treadle skips `treadle/error` gates. Recovery mirrors
  treadle's clear-to-retry: the coordinator fixes the artifact (or rewrites
  `shell/argv`/`shell/cwd`) and clears `shell/error`; the next scan finds a ready,
  un-errored, un-claimed `:shell` gate and re-runs the deterministic check, closing
  the gate on pass.
- **PLAN-ShellGates-001.A7 (attention surface — `S2`/`S4`):** `install!` calls
  `(workflow/register-executor! :shell gate-stalled?)` so `await!` stays silent
  (`:waiting`) on a healthy `:shell` gate and surfaces `:stalled` when `gate-stalled?`
  reports detail (a ready `:shell` gate carrying `shell/error`). It also registers a
  `stalled-shell-gates` named query mirroring the predicate for SQL-side coordinator
  inspection (treadle's `stalled-gates` precedent — but reed's is simpler: the failure
  detail lives on the gate itself, so the query needs no `delegates`-edge join back to
  a run row). No CLI op, no JSON socket op (`S2`, TEN-004/TEN-006).

## PLAN-ShellGates-001.P3 Affected areas

| ID | Area | Expected change |
|---|---|---|
| PLAN-ShellGates-001.AA1 | `spools/src/skein/spools/reed.clj` (**new**) | The executor spool: ns docstring; runtime-owned state (scan monitor + worker pool, versioned shape); `scan!`/`on-event`; claim + off-thread `ProcessBuilder` run with bounded capture and timeout; `complete!`-on-pass, `shell/error`-on-fail; `gate-stalled?`; `install!` registering the event handler, `register-executor! :shell`, and `stalled-shell-gates`. No module-level atoms; `*warn-on-reflection*`-clean (Java process interop is a reflection hot spot — type-hint `ProcessBuilder`/`Process`). |
| PLAN-ShellGates-001.AA2 | `spools/reed.md` (**new**) | Hand-authored contract doc in the style of `treadle.md`: overview, loading, the `shell/*` gate-attribute table, pass/fail/recovery/attention semantics, worked example, see-also. |
| PLAN-ShellGates-001.AA3 | `spools/reed.cookbook.md` (**new**) | Worked composition recipes: a `test -s` artifact gate; an explicit `["sh" "-c" …]` multi-file check; the `:subagent`→`:shell` composition (a `:shell` gate `:depends-on` the subagent gate — the `NG1`/option-B case expressed as composition); recovering a stalled `shell/error` gate. |
| PLAN-ShellGates-001.AA4 | `spools/reed.api.md` (**generated**) | Produced by `make api-docs` from `reed.clj` docstrings; never hand-edited. `make docs-check` gates drift. |
| PLAN-ShellGates-001.AA5 | `spools/workflow.md` §3 (Gates) and §9 (See also) | Add a note that a shipped classpath `:shell` executor (`reed`) exists, mirroring the existing treadle `:subagent` note (§3 ll. 171–174, §9 ll. 678–679). §4 executor-registry text is unchanged. |
| PLAN-ShellGates-001.AA6 | `spools/README.md` | Add a `skein.spools.reed` row to the **classpath** Index table (with `loom`), not the approved-local-root table. |
| PLAN-ShellGates-001.AA7 | `devflow/specs/alpha-surface.md` | Merge `DELTA-ShellGates-001.D1` on ship: add `reed` to the SPEC-005.C3 classpath spool list. |
| PLAN-ShellGates-001.AA8 | `test/skein/spools/reed_test.clj` (**new**) | Executable contract tests (see P5), ns `skein.spools.reed-test`, mirroring the classpath-spool test placement of `loom_test.clj`/`carder_test.clj`. |
| PLAN-ShellGates-001.AA9 | `.skein/init.clj` + `CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md` spool lists (**optional, PH3**) | If this repo runs reed live: a `runtime-alpha/use!` activation (`:call 'skein.spools.reed/install!`, ordered after `:skein/spools-workflow`) and a spool-list entry, plus a smoke-path touch if the smoke demo should exercise a `:shell` gate. |

## PLAN-ShellGates-001.P4 Contract and migration impact

- **PLAN-ShellGates-001.CM1:** Purely additive. No root behavioral spec changes
  (`PROP-ShellGates-001` "Related root specs"): the strand model, CLI, REPL API, and
  weaver runtime are untouched. **Verified** by reading all four root specs and the
  gate/executor surface: the `:shell` waiter is a freeform gate-hint value the engine
  already accepts (workflow.md §3), and `register-executor!` is already the
  in-contract generalization point (workflow.md §4). The only spec touched is the
  `SPEC-005` contract index, via `DELTA-ShellGates-001` (index membership only, no
  behavior). No other delta is warranted.
- **PLAN-ShellGates-001.CM2:** No new engine surface. reed adds no `workflow/*`
  attribute and no engine fn; it consumes `active-runs`/`next-steps`/`complete!`/
  `register-executor!`/`register-query!` exactly as treadle does.
- **PLAN-ShellGates-001.CM3:** Capability stays opt-in. A classpath spool is inert
  until a world's `.skein` activates it (`PROP-ShellGates-001.S2`); shipping on the
  classpath grants no world process execution it did not opt into.
- **PLAN-ShellGates-001.CM4:** No CLI/JSON-socket surface (TEN-006): inspection is
  `strand show` + the workflow surface + the `stalled-shell-gates` named query. No
  migration — new worlds and existing worlds are unaffected until they activate reed.

## PLAN-ShellGates-001.P5 Implementation phases

Each phase is an independently reviewable increment that lands green.

### PLAN-ShellGates-001.PH1 Executor spool + tested contract

Outcome: `spools/src/skein/spools/reed.clj` exists and its full behaviour contract is
green under a disposable weaver world — the `:shell` waiter is fulfilled off the event
thread, passes close the gate, failures stamp a distinct loud state, and recovery
re-runs the check. `test/skein/spools/reed_test.clj` covers the P5 matrix. No docs or
repo activation yet; the spool is loadable and tested in isolation.

### PLAN-ShellGates-001.PH2 Contract docs + indexes + generated api

Outcome: `spools/reed.md`, `spools/reed.cookbook.md`, and generated `spools/reed.api.md`
ship; `spools/workflow.md` §3/§9 note the `:shell` executor; `spools/README.md` gains
the classpath row; `DELTA-ShellGates-001.D1` is merged into
`devflow/specs/alpha-surface.md`. `make docs-check` (api-docs drift + site build) is
green.

### PLAN-ShellGates-001.PH3 Repo-live activation (optional) + smoke

Outcome: if the repo runs reed live, `.skein/init.clj` activates it (ordered after the
workflow spool) and the `CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md` spool lists gain a reed entry; the
smoke demo optionally exercises a trivial `:shell` gate end to end. If the repo defers
live activation, this phase records that decision and ships nothing but the note. This
phase touches the canonical world's **config file only** — never a running weaver;
pickup is a selected-workspace `runtime-alpha/reload!`, not a restart (see Task
context).

## PLAN-ShellGates-001.P6 Validation strategy

- **PLAN-ShellGates-001.V1 (`clojure -M:test`):** the new `skein.spools.reed-test`
  namespace, driving real trivial deterministic commands (`true`, `false`,
  `test -s <fixture>`, an `sh -c` that writes a fixture) rather than any harness.
  Required cases:
  - **pass** — a `:shell` gate whose command exits 0 closes the gate, records
    `workflow/outcome-by "shell"`, `shell/exit-code 0`, and bounded `shell/output`;
    the dependent step becomes ready.
  - **fail** — a non-zero command stamps `shell/error` + `shell/exit-code` + captured
    output, leaves the gate ready and stamped, and `gate-stalled?` /
    `stalled-shell-gates` report it.
  - **recovery** — fixing the artifact and clearing `shell/error` re-runs the check on
    the next scan and closes the gate; a stamped `shell/error` gate is **not** re-run
    on unrelated graph events (assert the expensive check runs once, not per mutation).
  - **invalid argv** — missing / blank / non-array / non-string-element `shell/argv`
    fails loudly onto `shell/error` with **no** process spawned.
  - **timeout** — a command exceeding `shell/timeout-secs` is killed and stamped
    `shell/error`; a non-positive/non-integer `shell/timeout-secs` fails loudly.
  - **isolation** — a non-`:shell` gate (waiter `:subagent`, `:ci`, `:human`) is never
    touched; `shell/output` capture is bounded (assert the bound on large output).
  - **composition** — a `:self`/`:subagent` step feeding a dependent `:shell` gate runs
    the check only once its dependency closes.
- **PLAN-ShellGates-001.V2 (quality gates):** `make fmt-check`, `make lint`,
  `make reflect-check` (reed compiles clean under `*warn-on-reflection*` — process
  interop must be hinted), and `make docs-check` (regenerate `reed.api.md`, fail on
  drift, build the site) — all at zero findings before commit.
- **PLAN-ShellGates-001.V3 (isolation rule — non-negotiable):** every reed test runs
  against a **disposable** weaver world and **never** the canonical `.skein` weaver.
  `git status --short` must show no generated SQLite/runtime artifacts after a run.
  When several agents run the suite concurrently, serialize behind the machine-wide
  advisory lock (`flock -w 3600 /tmp/skein-test.lock clojure -M:test`).
- **PLAN-ShellGates-001.V4 (test harness precedent — open question, see P7.Q2):** the
  sibling executor (`test/skein/treadle_test.clj`) drives its event-fired contract with
  `skein.spools.test-support/with-runtime` (an in-process real runtime that fires
  events synchronously and polls with `test-support/poll-until`), which is the closest
  precedent and satisfies V3. The proposal `S6` and the repo rules name
  `skein.test.alpha` disposable weaver worlds. Both honour V3; the implementer should
  follow the treadle `with-runtime` precedent unless a full socket weaver is genuinely
  needed, and flag the choice at review.

## PLAN-ShellGates-001.P7 Risks and open questions

- **PLAN-ShellGates-001.R1 (blocking the event thread):** the weaver event handler must
  return promptly. Running a child process (an expensive `make test`) inline would
  stall every other event handler. Mitigation: A3 — the handler only claims and submits;
  the process runs on the spool-owned worker pool. Review must confirm no
  `.waitFor`/blocking read happens on the event thread.
- **PLAN-ShellGates-001.R2 (gate-readiness race with concurrent scans / sibling
  executors):** two scans (or a scan racing the initial `install!` scan) could both see
  the same ready `:shell` gate and double-launch a process. Mitigation: the scan
  serializes on the runtime-owned monitor (A1), and the claim marker is stamped before
  dispatch and skipped thereafter (A3/A6) — the treadle idempotency pattern. Review the
  claim/skip predicate against the recovery flow so a cleared error is re-run but a live
  claim is not.
- **PLAN-ShellGates-001.R3 (unbounded output):** a chatty command could write gigabytes.
  Mitigation: capture a bounded tail only (A4 `shell/output`, `NG5`); never buffer the
  whole stream into an attribute. Read the child's stdout/stderr into a bounded ring so
  a runaway process cannot exhaust weaver heap before the timeout fires.
- **PLAN-ShellGates-001.R4 (timeout enforcement + process cleanup):** a hung child must
  be killed and its subtree not leaked. Mitigation: `shell/timeout-secs` enforced via
  `Process/waitFor` with a timeout then `destroyForcibly`; ensure worker-pool shutdown
  on runtime stop does not leave orphaned processes.
- **PLAN-ShellGates-001.R5 (macOS/CI process semantics):** `ProcessBuilder` argv-exec,
  cwd resolution, and exit-code/signal semantics differ subtly across macOS (dev) and
  Linux (CI). Mitigation: tests use POSIX-portable trivial commands (`true`/`false`/
  `test -s`); assert on exit code, not signal detail; keep the timeout-kill assertion
  tolerant of platform kill semantics.
- **PLAN-ShellGates-001.R6 (crash window):** a weaver crash between claim and outcome
  leaves a gate claimed with no live process. Because the check is deterministic and
  idempotent, recovery is safe: document that clearing the claim marker re-runs the
  check (unlike treadle, there is no separate run strand to reconcile — this is
  strictly simpler). Confirm the claim marker distinguishes "running" from "errored" so
  a crashed-mid-run gate is recoverable by the same clear-to-retry path.
- **PLAN-ShellGates-001.Q1 (repo live activation — PH3):** does this repo activate reed
  in its canonical `.skein` now, or ship the spool + docs and defer activation? A
  coordinator/user decision (the proposal lists activation as optional). Does not block
  PH1/PH2.
- **PLAN-ShellGates-001.Q2 (test harness — `with-runtime` vs `skein.test.alpha`):** see
  V4. Recommend following the treadle `with-runtime` precedent; confirm with the
  coordinator if a full socket weaver world is preferred for parity with the proposal's
  wording.

## PLAN-ShellGates-001.P8 Task context

For an AFK implementer picking this up cold:

- **File map anchors.** Reference implementation: `spools/shuttle/src/skein/spools/treadle.clj`
  (event handler, `scan!`, idempotent claim, `complete!`-on-success, `gate-stalled?`,
  `register-executor!`, `register-query!`, runtime-owned versioned `spool-state`,
  scan monitor) and its contract doc `spools/shuttle/treadle.md`. Classpath-spool
  shape and install: `spools/src/skein/spools/loom.clj` + `.skein/init.clj`
  activation of `:skein/spools-loom`. Gate/executor surface consumed:
  `spools/src/skein/spools/workflow.clj` (`active-runs`, `next-steps`, `complete!`
  requires `:by` on a gate, `register-executor!`) and `spools/workflow.md` §3/§4.
  Test precedents: `test/skein/treadle_test.clj` (event-fired executor, `with-runtime`,
  `poll-until`) and `test/skein/spools/loom_test.clj` (classpath-spool test placement);
  `docs/library-authoring.md` §3 for `skein.test.alpha` worlds.
- **What is shuttle-specific in treadle and must NOT leak into reed:** `shuttle/*`
  attributes, the `spawn-run!` call, the treadle preamble, session resume,
  `max-attempts`, the `delegates` edge + separate run strand, the blank-result-is-
  failure rule, and the `treadle/superseded-by` edge-lockstep machinery. reed has no
  separate run strand: its outcome lives on the gate itself, so its stall predicate and
  query are strictly simpler than treadle's.
- **Tenets that bite:** TEN-003 FAIL LOUDLY — missing/blank/non-array `shell/argv`,
  bad `shell/timeout-secs`, spawn error, non-zero exit, and timeout all stamp a loud
  distinct `shell/error`; never a "sensible default" and never a silent shell wrap.
  TEN-004 Less is More — one waiter, one executor, no CLI op, no `:ci` family, no
  command registry, bounded output only. TEN-002 — the trust boundary is the workflow
  definition; `shell/argv` shape is authored in trusted definition code and params
  supply data only. Implementation discipline (CLAUDE.md): no module-level atoms
  (runtime-owned `spool-state`), every ns gets a docstring, and the spool must compile
  clean under `*warn-on-reflection*` (`make reflect-check`) — process interop needs
  type hints.
- **Do NOT** restart/stop/reload the canonical mill or weaver. This is code + docs.
  Any live poking uses a disposable `--workspace "$(mktemp -d)"`. Config pickup for a
  selected workspace is `runtime-alpha/reload!`, never a restart.
- **Task-queue slicing (recorded 2026-07-07 by the task-breakdown run).** The queue
  is three sequential AFK tasks, one per phase: `TASK-ShellGates-001` (PH1 — reed.clj
  + full `reed_test.clj` matrix), `TASK-ShellGates-002` (PH2 — `reed.md`/cookbook/
  generated `reed.api.md`, workflow.md/README indexes, `DELTA-ShellGates-001` merge),
  `TASK-ShellGates-003` (PH3 — `.skein/init.clj` activation + `CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md`
  entries + full validation sweep). The suggested reed-core / failure-semantics split
  (slices 1+2) was **deliberately merged** into `TASK-ShellGates-001`: the loud,
  distinct failure path (`A5`/`A6`, the feature's whole point per `G3`/`S4`) and the
  claim/skip predicate are load-bearing to the executor's core, so a happy-path-only
  reed is not an independently shippable increment — matching treadle's shape
  (scan/execute/error is one coherent namespace) and this plan's own single-increment
  framing of PH1. `TASK-ShellGates-002` also has the implementer register reed in
  `scripts/generate_api_docs.clj`'s explicit `spool-docs` list (the api-doc generator
  enumerates spools by name, so `reed.api.md` is invisible to `make api-docs` until
  listed).

## PLAN-ShellGates-001.P9 Developer Notes

- **Root-spec delta verification (records `PROP-ShellGates-001` "Related root specs"):**
  read all four root specs plus the gate/executor surface; confirmed no behavioral root
  spec needs a delta. The `:shell` waiter is an already-accepted freeform gate hint
  (`workflow.md` §3, ll. 150–174: `:ci` is a documented example waiter with no
  consumer, which is exactly this shape) and `register-executor!` is the already-shipped
  in-contract generalization point (`workflow.md` §4, ll. 288–302). The single spec
  touched is the `SPEC-005` contract **index**, via `DELTA-ShellGates-001` — membership
  only, no behavior.
- **Contradiction found between proposal and code (surfaced for the coordinator):** the
  proposal `S6` and the repo agent rules call for testing against `skein.test.alpha`
  disposable weaver worlds, but the sibling executor the proposal names as the precedent
  (`test/skein/treadle_test.clj`) tests with `skein.spools.test-support/with-runtime`, an
  in-process real runtime, not a `skein.test.alpha` socket world. Both satisfy the
  never-canonical-weaver isolation rule; the plan recommends the treadle `with-runtime`
  precedent (V4, Q2). Not a design contradiction — a test-harness choice — but recorded
  so the implementer/reviewer picks deliberately.
- **Pre-existing index observation (not fixed here):** `SPEC-005.C3`'s classpath spool
  list does not currently include `loom` (shipped after that spec's last update). This
  delta adds only `reed`; the `loom` omission is out of scope for this feature and left
  for the coordinator to note separately.
- **Naming carry-over:** the proposal predates the `Q1` resolution and uses the working
  name `skein.spools.shell-gate` / `spools/shell-gate.md` throughout. Read every such
  reference as `skein.spools.reed` / `spools/reed.md` (`PLAN-ShellGates-001.D1`).
