# Shell Gates Proposal

**Document ID:** `PROP-ShellGates-001`
**Last Updated:** 2026-07-07
**Related RFCs:** [RFC-010 Shuttle-backed Agent Coordination](../../rfcs/2026-07-02-shuttle-backed-coordination.md) (the treadle `:subagent` gate executor this feature is a sibling to); adjacent [RFC-009 Weaver Scheduler Primitive](../../rfcs/2026-06-29-weaver-scheduler.md) (the weaver async-runtime substrate an off-event-thread executor runs on — adjacent, no conflict)
**Related root specs:** No behavioral root-spec change (strand-model / cli / repl-api / daemon-runtime are untouched; this is spool-layer behaviour over the existing gate primitive). [Alpha Surface](../../specs/alpha-surface.md) gains a spool-index entry for the new contract doc (S6).
**Related contracts:** [Workflow spool](../../../spools/workflow.md) (§3 Gates, §4 executor registry / awaiting attention, §7 vocabulary), [Treadle spool](../../../spools/shuttle/treadle.md) (the precedent gate executor), [Shuttle spool](../../../spools/shuttle/README.md) (§3 harnesses, §5 run/result semantics), [Agents spool](../../../spools/agents/README.md) (the agent-plan `validation` field)
**Source:** problem statement authored in the `notes` workspace (`.skein/proposals/2026-07-07-workflow-shell-gates.md` there) — an external workspace not shipped with this repo and not required reading; all load-bearing evidence is restated below.

## PROP-ShellGates-001.P1 Problem

Workflows have no mechanical done-signal. Every close of a poured workflow step
is either a **human/agent assertion** — a `:self` step the driving agent
completes, or a checkpoint choice — or a **subagent run's success**, which
treadle records when its shuttle run closes with a non-blank result. Neither is
a machine check of the *artifact*. There is no workflow equivalent of the CI
primitive "run `test -s <file>` (or `make test`, or a schema check) and fail the
run loudly if it fails."

This is a regression. The agents spool's plan-creation pattern accepts a
per-task `validation` field — "list of commands that **prove** it," explicitly
contrasted with `harness` which picks *who does the work* (agents README §3, §5).
When a pipeline is expressed as an `agent-plan` graph, every task can carry its
proof command. When the same pipeline is converted to a workflow, that line has
nowhere to go: a gate's fields (`shuttle/harness`, `shuttle/prompt`, and the
optional `shuttle/cwd`/`shuttle/max-attempts`) all describe the agent run — none
carries a validation command — so the check gets demoted to **instruction prose
on a human checkpoint**
("before presenting to the human, open every output file — never trust worker
status alone, a gate can close on a hollow run"). The mechanical, durable,
re-runnable check becomes a paragraph asking a person to look.

### Evidence

Two failure modes, both observed in the source workspace's research pipeline
retro, motivate a check independent of run exit status:

- **Hollow success.** A worker reports done and its gate closes, but the
  artifact is missing or empty. Workers intermittently lost their `strand` CLI
  and self-reported status was untrustworthy; the coordinator had to open every
  file by hand. A `test -s` gate makes that verification mechanical and durable.
- **The inverse.** A run *failed* (context overflow) *after* writing a complete
  deliverable — run status says failed, the artifact is fine. Shuttle's own
  blank-result rule (README §5) acknowledges this gap at the *run* level (an
  exit-0 run with a blank result is `failed`, not `done`, because "the result is
  the worker's report"), but nothing checks the *artifact*. A file/content check
  distinguishes both cases from run exit status.

### The seam this slots into

Two facts about the current code shape the recommendation and make a new gate
executor the natural fit — the workflow engine itself needs zero changes.

- **Gate `waiter` is a freeform actor hint with a pluggable executor registry.**
  `(gate id title waiter …)` stamps `workflow/gate <waiter>`; the docs give
  `:ci`, `:human`, `:subagent` as examples, and only `:subagent` has a consumer.
  `workflow/register-executor!` keys a **stall predicate** by waiter name, so
  `await!` stays silent (`:waiting`) on a healthy executor-owned gate and
  surfaces `:stalled` when the predicate reports detail; a waiter with no
  registered executor surfaces immediately as `:gate` — there is no silent
  default (workflow.md §4). The `:ci` example in the docs is exactly this
  proposal's use case, still with no fulfiller.
- **Treadle is the precedent executor.** It registers a weaver event handler
  that scans ready gates through the workflow surface and fulfils each, records
  outcome and failure as durable attributes rather than throwing the scan away,
  and *separately* registers its stall predicate via `register-executor!
  :subagent`. Recovery is coordinator-owned: a stuck gate stays ready and
  stamped. Treadle is the only namespace that knows both vocabularies, precisely
  because the workflow engine never executes.

### Rejected alternatives (decision records)

- **The `sh`-harness `:subagent` gate is blocked and the wrong shape.** The
  obvious workaround — a `:subagent` gate on the shipped `sh` harness with the
  validation script as the prompt — does not work and is wrong even if it did.
  Treadle prefixes a prose preamble onto every gate prompt before launch; the
  `sh` harness is `:prompt-via :arg` and runs its prompt as a script (it must be
  — `sh -c`'s script is a required positional argument, so it can never read the
  prompt from stdin, shuttle README §3), so the injected sentence runs as shell
  and the harness dies with a syntax error. Even fixed, abusing an agent-run seam
  for a deterministic command costs a shuttle run, records "harness output"
  rather than "check result," and inherits attempts, preambles, session resume,
  and the blank-result-is-failure rule — `test -s file` produces *no* stdout on
  success, which shuttle would record as a failed run.
- **Option B — a `workflow/validate` attribute on existing steps/gates, run at
  close time — rejected.** It overloads gate-close semantics and forces *some*
  execution engine to run commands at close time, reintroducing the execution
  coupling the chosen shape avoids; and B's own "validate after a subagent gate
  succeeds" case is already expressible as composition — a `:shell` gate that
  `:depends-on` the `:subagent` gate, its own strand in the frontier, visible and
  recoverable, with no new close-time hook (Less is More, TEN-004). The lost
  agent-plan `validation` ergonomic can be restored later in the *pattern* layer
  (`agent-plan`/`delegate-pipeline` pouring a trailing `:shell` gate per task)
  with no engine or executor change; that is a follow-up, not this feature.
- **Option C — fix only the treadle/`sh` collision and bless `sh` gates as the
  idiom — rejected** (see NG6): it legitimizes the wrong shape.

### Corrections to the source framing

Two source-proposal framings need correcting so the plan does not inherit them:

1. The agent-plan `validation` field was **not** engine-enforced either. Agents
   README §5 is explicit that the *coordinator re-runs* those commands at verify
   time before closing a task. So the pre-conversion pipeline had a *recorded,
   durable, structured* check that a human ran — not an automatic one. The
   `:shell` gate is therefore strictly *more* mechanical than what was lost: the
   executor runs the check, not the coordinator. That strengthens the case.
2. The source lists reusing shuttle's process execution as a pro. The code shows
   the opposite: shuttle's blank-result-is-failure rule, attempts, preambles, and
   resume are all wrong for a deterministic check, and a silent successful check
   (`test -s`, no stdout) would be recorded as a *failed* run. The executor must
   run the process directly; that is a feature, not a cost.

## PROP-ShellGates-001.P2 Goals

- **PROP-ShellGates-001.G1:** Restore a mechanical, durable, re-runnable check of
  the *artifact* to workflows — a machine done-signal independent of run exit
  status — closing the gap left when the agent-plan `validation` line had nowhere
  to go in the workflow conversion.
- **PROP-ShellGates-001.G2:** Deliver it without changing the workflow engine: a
  new gate waiter fulfilled by a separate executor adapter (a treadle sibling),
  preserving "the engine never executes; the driving agent interprets ready-step
  data" (workflow.md §3), which is what keeps definitions forge-agnostic.
- **PROP-ShellGates-001.G3:** Make a failed check a distinct, loud,
  coordinator-visible state — unmistakably different from a failed agent run —
  recoverable by fixing the artifact or argv and clearing the error, after which
  the next scan re-runs the deterministic check and closes the gate (FAIL LOUDLY,
  TEN-003).
- **PROP-ShellGates-001.G4:** Keep deterministic checks out of the agent-run
  seam: run the process directly, with no shuttle run and none of shuttle's
  attempts, preambles, session resume, or blank-result semantics — every one of
  which is wrong for a command.

## PROP-ShellGates-001.P3 Non-goals

- **PROP-ShellGates-001.NG1:** No option B — no `workflow/validate` attribute on
  arbitrary steps/gates run at close time. The validate-after-a-gate case is
  composition (a `:shell` gate depending on the prior gate), not a new close-time
  hook.
- **PROP-ShellGates-001.NG2:** No general external-check family and no `:ci`
  waiter or shared scaffolding (TEN-004). The executor registry *is* the
  generalization point — a future `:ci` consumer registers its own executor and
  event handler exactly as this spool and treadle do. `:ci` stays a documented
  example with no consumer.
- **PROP-ShellGates-001.NG3:** No named/registered-command registry for argv.
  The trust boundary is the workflow definition (TEN-002, agents are trusted):
  `shell/argv` is always produced by trusted definition code — the command and
  its shape are authored in the definition's attribute fn, and pour-time params
  supply only *data* elements (file paths, names) that the definition
  interpolates into that vector. A definition that passes a whole
  caller-supplied argv through from params has moved the trust boundary itself;
  that is a definition-authoring error, not a supported shape. This is the same
  split treadle already accepts for a `:subagent` gate's `shuttle/prompt`, and a
  command registry would be new surface for no real safety gain when the
  definition is trusted code.
- **PROP-ShellGates-001.NG4:** No implicit shell wrapping. `shell/argv` is a JSON
  array of strings executed directly; an author who wants shell features writes
  `["sh" "-c" "…"]` explicitly, so there is no silent shell-injection surface
  (TEN-003).
- **PROP-ShellGates-001.NG5:** No unbounded output capture. Captured output on
  gate attributes is bounded; a full `<gate-id>.shell.log` under the weaver state
  dir is a noted future escape hatch, not built now (TEN-004).
- **PROP-ShellGates-001.NG6:** No fix to the treadle/`sh`-harness preamble
  collision, and no blessing of `sh`-harness `:subagent` gates as the validation
  idiom. The `:shell` gate replaces that workaround, so the collision no longer
  matters for the supported path; the treadle preamble stays correct for real
  agent runs. One optional, independent hardening is flagged for the plan but not
  owned here: treadle could reject an `sh`-harness `:subagent` gate loudly at
  spawn instead of producing a confusing downstream shell error (TEN-003) — a
  one-line guard that can ship separately.
- **PROP-ShellGates-001.NG7:** No implementation strategy, phase breakdown,
  migration mechanics, or detailed testing strategy/test matrix here — those
  belong in the feature plan — see
  [workflow-shell-gates.plan.md](./workflow-shell-gates.plan.md) for the
  `shell/*` attribute contract table and the test matrix.

## PROP-ShellGates-001.P4 Proposed scope

- **PROP-ShellGates-001.S1 (`:shell` waiter vocabulary):** A new `:shell` gate
  waiter. A workflow author declares an ordinary gate whose waiter is `:shell`,
  carrying argv, cwd, and timeout on its attributes. Being an ordinary strand, it
  participates in readiness, `describe`, `run-history`, and bond/dep blocking like
  any other gate; deterministic checks stop masquerading as agent runs.
- **PROP-ShellGates-001.S2 (classpath executor spool as fulfiller):** A
  reference/classpath spool (working name `skein.spools.shell-gate`, a sibling to
  the workflow spool it serves) watches ready `:shell` gates, runs each command
  **off the weaver event thread** on a spool-owned worker executor (runtime-owned
  state via `skein.api.runtime.alpha/spool-state`, no module-level atoms, shut
  down on runtime stop), and closes the gate via the ordinary workflow surface
  (`complete!` `:by "shell"`, summary in `workflow/notes`) on exit 0. It registers
  `register-executor! :shell` with a stall predicate over `shell/error` gates plus
  a `stalled-shell-gates` named query, and adds no CLI op — inspection is `strand
  show` and the workflow surface, exactly as treadle. It ships on the classpath
  (not a local root) because it has no external-tool coupling — it runs processes
  itself and depends only on the classpath workflow engine; the capability stays
  opt-in, since a spool is inert until a world's `.skein` activates it.
- **PROP-ShellGates-001.S3 (gate attribute surface — names, not code):** The
  `shell/*` vocabulary on the gate strand (all plain JSON `TEXT`): `shell/argv`
  (required JSON string array, executed without an implicit shell; missing / blank
  / non-array fails loudly), `shell/cwd` and `shell/timeout-secs` (optional
  inputs), and the recorded outcomes `shell/exit-code`, `shell/output` (bounded
  tail), and `shell/error` (durable failure detail). The pass outcome rides the
  ordinary workflow vocabulary — `workflow/outcome-by "shell"`, `workflow/notes` =
  the short result summary; no new `workflow/*` attribute is introduced.
- **PROP-ShellGates-001.S4 (loud, distinct failure state):** A failed check
  (non-zero exit, timeout, spawn error, or invalid argv) does **not** close the
  gate and does **not** masquerade as a failed shuttle run. It stamps a distinct
  `shell/error` (with `shell/exit-code` and captured output) and leaves the gate
  ready and stamped — the coordinator-visible stalled state. Because the check is
  deterministic, a stamped `shell/error` is skipped until cleared (an expensive
  `make test` runs once per deliberate request, not on every graph mutation),
  and clearing it re-runs the check on the next scan.
- **PROP-ShellGates-001.S5 (bounded output on gate attributes):** Exit code and a
  bounded stdout+stderr tail live on the gate's attribute map — the attribute map
  is the contract, machine-readable via `strand show`, and terse checks
  (`test -s`, a `make test` tail) fit comfortably. Output is bounded on purpose
  (large attribute payloads are a known cost, per the attr-scaling work); full
  logs are the future file escape hatch, not built now.
- **PROP-ShellGates-001.S6 (contract-doc obligations and tested contract):** It
  ships with a new spool contract doc `spools/shell-gate.md` (+ `.cookbook.md` and
  generated `.api.md`) in the style of `treadle.md`, a `spools/workflow.md`
  §3/§9 note that a shipped `:shell` executor exists (mirroring the treadle note;
  §4 executor-registry text is unchanged), a `spools/README.md` index row, and a
  `devflow/specs/alpha-surface.md` spool-index entry, plus optional `.skein/init.clj`
  activation and CLAUDE.md spool-list entry if this repo runs it live. Its
  pass / fail / recovery / invalid-argv / timeout / isolation / composition
  behaviour is a shipped, tested contract validated against a disposable
  `skein.test.alpha` weaver world (never the canonical weaver); the concrete test
  matrix is owned by the plan.

## PROP-ShellGates-001.P5 Open questions

- **PROP-ShellGates-001.Q1:** Final spool name — `skein.spools.shell-gate` (the
  working name) or a loom-themed rename (e.g. `reed`, the part that beats each
  pick into a consistent checked position). Deferred to spec time; it changes no
  design decision. Every substantive design question the source proposal left open
  (trust boundary, failure semantics, whether to build a general `:ci` family,
  where captured output lives) is **resolved** and recorded as decisions above —
  NG3/NG4 (trust boundary), G3/S4 (failure semantics), NG2 (no `:ci` family), and
  S5/NG5 (bounded output on gate attributes).
