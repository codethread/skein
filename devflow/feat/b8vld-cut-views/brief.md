# Brief: cut the views namespace (b8vld)

Card b8vld (p1, gates the v1 stamp b3v1r): decide whether `skein.api.views.alpha` ships
into the accretion-only v1 or is cut.

## Decision

User decision 2026-07-18: **CUT, aggressively.**

Grounds, confirmed against the live tree:

- Zero first-party consumers: no in-repo spool, no sibling spool, no batteries op, no CLI
  weave. Only wiring is three client RPC dispatch slots, one smoke section, and tests.
- Views are a strictly weaker duplicate of read-class ops: `register-op!` with
  `:hook-class :read` gives everything a view gives plus doc, arg-spec, return shape, CLI
  weave, provenance, loud collision failure, deadline class, and streaming. Declarative
  graph reads are already covered by named queries.
- The audit counterweight (out-of-tree client on `:views`/`:view!`) is closed: the Go CLI
  has zero references, `skein.userland.alpha` names views only as unwrapped surface, and
  the sibling-spool sweep found nothing.
- Under the accretion regime re-entry is free: a future view mechanism returns as a new
  root namespace at zero cost, while keeping it now freezes an unused mechanism forever.

## Scope

Remove the mechanism whole: namespace, client RPC slots, weaver registry state, smoke
section, tests, spec contracts (SPEC-004.C51/C56–C59 and every views mention in the root
specs), and generated API docs. No replacement surface is introduced.
