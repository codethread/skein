# Plan: cut the views namespace (b8vld)

Status: Reviewed

Single-sitting removal; direct implementation, no task queue. The proposal owns the
complete removal inventory; this plan owns ordering and validation.

## Approach

One atomic cut across four layers, ordered so each validation gate can run meaningfully:

1. **Code**: delete `skein.api.views.alpha`; unwire the client RPC slots, the
   `view-registry` accessor in `skein.core.weaver.access`, the runtime-state atom and
   reload reset in `skein.core.weaver.runtime`, and the smoke-suite view section. Drop
   views from the `weaver`/`scheduler` alpha ns docstrings and the userland docstring.
2. **Tests**: delete pure view-surface assertions (`alpha_test`, `client_test`,
   `spools_test` view line); rewrite `weaver-view-registry-operations` in `weaver_test`
   as an op-based spool-classloader test so the addURL+register+invoke contract keeps
   coverage through `op!`.
3. **Specs**: merge the four staged deltas into the root specs (`alpha-surface`,
   `daemon-runtime`, `repl-api`, `cli`); retire SPEC-004.C56–C59 without renumbering.
4. **Docs**: remove views from `docs/reference.md`, `docs/clojure-crash-course.md`,
   `docs/api/README.md`, `docs/spools/customisation.md`,
   `docs/spools/writing-shared-spools.md`, and the `mkdocs.yml` nav; drop `"views"` from
   `scripts/generate_api_docs.clj`, delete `docs/api/views.api.md`, and regenerate api
   docs. `devflow/prd/runtime-transformations.md` (PRD-001, live): drop the views goal
   and namespace bullets and recast the "feature view" example as a read-class
   registered op — the PRD's durable-facts/runtime-transformation thesis is untouched.

## Validation

Per-slice: cold focused runs of the touched test namespaces. Acceptance: full locked
suite under the flock, `go test ./...` in `cli/`, `clojure -M:smoke`,
`make spool-suite-gate`, `make fmt-check lint reflect-check docs-check`, `make api-docs`
with `git status --short` showing no generated SQLite or runtime metadata artifacts
afterwards. The tree must end with zero live mentions of the views *mechanism*
(`skein.api.views.alpha`, view registry, `register-view!`/`view!`/`views` operations)
outside archived feature folders and RFCs; unrelated senses of the word (workflow
"step views", `gh pr view`) are exempt.

## Developer notes

- The workflow-checkpoint "step views" wording in `cli.md`/`.skein/workflows.clj` and
  `gh pr view` invocations are unrelated senses of the word; leave them alone.
- Archived RFCs and `devflow/archive`/`devflow/feat` history stay untouched.
