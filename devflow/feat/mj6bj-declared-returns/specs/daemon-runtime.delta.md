# Weaver runtime delta for declared op returns

**Document ID:** `DELTA-Dcr-dr-001`
**Root spec:** [daemon-runtime.md](../../../specs/daemon-runtime.md) (`SPEC-004`)
**Feature:** [../proposal.md](../proposal.md) (`PROP-Dcr-001`)
**Contract:** [../brief.md](../brief.md)
**Status:** Draft
**Last Updated:** 2026-07-14

## DELTA-Dcr-dr-001.P1 Summary

This feature extends the operation-registry contracts in `SPEC-004.C63a-d`.
Registry entries may carry a validated `:returns` declaration, and full help
renders it. Ordinary op invocation still returns the handler result without
checking or changing it.

## DELTA-Dcr-dr-001.P2 Contract changes

- **DELTA-Dcr-dr-001.CC1 — `SPEC-004.C63a`: add return metadata.** The accepted
  op metadata keys gain optional `:returns`. Registration and replacement retain
  the declaration in the registry entry after validating it through
  `skein.api.return-shape.alpha`. Unknown metadata keys continue to fail.

- **DELTA-Dcr-dr-001.CC2 — `SPEC-004.C63b`: no serving-path check.** Declared
  returns do not wrap handler invocation, emitted stream items, the handler's
  terminal result, or socket response encoding. `op!` calls the resolved handler
  and returns its result under the existing dispatch contract. This remains true
  if another feature adds an independent result transform at that boundary.

- **DELTA-Dcr-dr-001.CC3 — `SPEC-004.C63c`: render returns in full help.** The
  built-in `help` op adds a JSON-safe `returns` projection to one-op detail when
  the entry declares `:returns`. The no-argument registry projection is
  unchanged.

- **DELTA-Dcr-dr-001.CC4 — `SPEC-004.C63d`: validate declaration structure at
  registration.** `register-op!` and `replace-op!` call the shared return-shape
  validator. A malformed scalar, map, collection, subcommand, or stream
  declaration fails before the registry changes. For a subcommand arg-spec, the
  declared return subcommand names must match the arg-spec names exactly. For a
  `:stream? true` op, each return case must declare both `:emits` and `:result`;
  stream cases are rejected on non-stream ops.

## DELTA-Dcr-dr-001.P3 Design decisions

### DELTA-Dcr-dr-001.D1 Return declarations are registry metadata

- **Decision:** Put `:returns` beside `:arg-spec` in the existing metadata map
  and registry entry.
- **Rationale:** The registry already owns op discovery, replacement, provenance,
  and registration-time metadata validation. A second store could drift.
- **Rejected:** A separate return registry or declarations attached to handler
  vars outside `register-op!`.

### DELTA-Dcr-dr-001.D2 Validation stops at declaration boundaries

- **Decision:** Validate declaration data at register/replace time, not handler
  values during ordinary invocation.
- **Rationale:** Bad authored data should fail before publication. Per-request
  result checking adds serving-path work and changes runtime failure behavior for
  a contract whose primary enforcement belongs in tests.
- **Rejected:** Wrapping every handler or `:op/emit!` call with the evaluator.

### DELTA-Dcr-dr-001.D3 Routed and streaming cases are explicit

- **Decision:** A subcommand op declares one return case for every arg-spec
  subcommand. A streaming case declares emitted items separately from the
  terminal result.
- **Rationale:** One broad map shape would erase the useful differences between
  verbs, and one stream shape would leave either emitted items or the terminal
  result undocumented.
- **Rejected:** Shape unions, inferred subcommand routing, and treating a stream
  as a homogeneous collection returned by the handler.

## DELTA-Dcr-dr-001.P4 Open questions

None.
