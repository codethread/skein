# REPL API delta for declared op returns

**Document ID:** `DELTA-Dcr-repl-001`
**Root spec:** [repl-api.md](../../../specs/repl-api.md) (`SPEC-003`)
**Feature:** [../proposal.md](../proposal.md) (`PROP-Dcr-001`)
**Contract:** [../brief.md](../brief.md)
**Status:** Draft
**Last Updated:** 2026-07-14

## DELTA-Dcr-repl-001.P1 Summary

This feature adds a narrowly named public namespace for return shapes and one
author-side op-result check. It extends `SPEC-003.C60/C62` and
`SPEC-003.C28/C30` without moving any existing namespace between tiers.

## DELTA-Dcr-repl-001.P2 Contract changes

- **DELTA-Dcr-repl-001.CC1 — `SPEC-003.C60`: add the return-shape companion
  namespace.** `skein.api.return-shape.alpha` is the blessed, pure return-shape
  vocabulary shared by the registry, help, author tests, and real
  spool-to-spool consumption seams. It exposes `validate!`, `explain`, and
  `check!`. The namespace has no runtime, registry, socket, or CLI parser state
  and follows `SPEC-003.C19`'s accretion rule.

- **DELTA-Dcr-repl-001.CC2 — define the minimal shape language.** A shape is a
  finite inline EDN tree. Scalar leaves are `:string`, `:integer`, `:number`,
  `:boolean`, `:null`, and `:json`; `:json` accepts any JSON-compatible value.
  A map uses `{:type :map :required {<keyword> <shape> ...} :optional
  {<keyword> <shape> ...} :extra <shape>}`. `:required` and `:optional` default
  to empty maps; overlapping keys fail declaration validation; undeclared keys
  fail value checking unless `:extra` supplies their common value shape. A
  homogeneous sequential collection uses `{:type :collection :items <shape>}`.
  There are no functions, arbitrary predicates, coercions, defaults, unions,
  named references, or recursive declarations.

- **DELTA-Dcr-repl-001.CC3 — define declaration routing.** A flat non-stream op
  uses a shape directly. A subcommand op uses `{:subcommands {<name-string>
  <return-case> ...}}`, with exactly the arg-spec's subcommand names. A stream
  return case uses `{:stream {:emits <shape> :result <shape>}}`; a non-stream
  return case is a shape. `validate!` validates authored structure, `explain`
  returns the same contract as JSON-safe data, and `check!` returns the checked
  value or throws structured mismatch data carrying at least the failing path,
  expected shape, and actual value.

- **DELTA-Dcr-repl-001.CC4 — `SPEC-003.C62`: extend op registration metadata.**
  `register-op!` and `replace-op!` accept `:returns` under the registry contract
  in `SPEC-004.C63a-d`. Workspace `defop` and direct spool registrations pass it
  through the same metadata route; no second macro or registry is introduced.

- **DELTA-Dcr-repl-001.CC5 — `SPEC-003.C28`: add one author-side result check.**
  `skein.test.alpha/check-op-return!` accepts an explicit runtime, operation,
  optional subcommand/stream channel context, and a captured value. It resolves
  the registered declaration, delegates to
  `skein.api.return-shape.alpha/check!`, and returns the value on success. A
  mismatch throws with the operation, selected declaration, failing path, and
  actual value so the cold `clojure.test` run exits non-zero.

- **DELTA-Dcr-repl-001.CC6 — `SPEC-003.C30`: narrow the no-assertion boundary.**
  `skein.test.alpha` still has no general assertion DSL or per-command wrappers.
  `check-op-return!` is the sole output-contract helper: it checks values already
  captured by an op-owner test and does not invoke an op, start a CLI process,
  or add a spool activation wrapper.

## DELTA-Dcr-repl-001.P3 Design decisions

### DELTA-Dcr-repl-001.D1 Return shapes have their own public namespace

- **Decision:** Use `skein.api.return-shape.alpha`, not
  `skein.api.cli.alpha`, as the public home.
- **Rationale:** Return checks serve author tests and spool-to-spool adapters as
  well as CLI help. The CLI parser may delegate help rendering to the shared
  namespace, but it does not own output semantics.
- **Rejected:** Putting the evaluator in `skein.test.alpha`, in the CLI parser,
  or in an internal core namespace.

### DELTA-Dcr-repl-001.D2 Closed maps are the default

- **Decision:** Map shapes reject undeclared keys unless `:extra` is present.
- **Rationale:** Exact projections, including the canonical entity projection,
  need drift detection. Open maps remain expressible for attribute bags and
  other key-dynamic JSON objects.
- **Rejected:** Open maps by default or a predicate escape hatch.

### DELTA-Dcr-repl-001.D3 Tests check captured values

- **Decision:** `check-op-return!` consumes an already-captured value and an
  explicit runtime.
- **Rationale:** Op-owner suites already know how to construct valid inputs and
  fixtures. A generic helper cannot safely invent invocations for mutating or
  blocking ops.
- **Rejected:** A test helper that discovers and invokes every registered op.

## DELTA-Dcr-repl-001.P4 Open questions

None.
