# CLI surface delta for declared op returns

**Document ID:** `DELTA-Dcr-cli-001`
**Root spec:** [cli.md](../../../specs/cli.md) (`SPEC-002`)
**Feature:** [../proposal.md](../proposal.md) (`PROP-Dcr-001`)
**Contract:** [../brief.md](../brief.md)
**Status:** Draft
**Last Updated:** 2026-07-14

## DELTA-Dcr-cli-001.P1 Summary

This feature extends `SPEC-002.C39` only. Full op help gains the declared return
contract beside the existing arg-spec projection. The no-argument help listing
stays compact, and the Go dispatcher still treats both declarations as opaque
weaver-owned result data.

## DELTA-Dcr-cli-001.P2 Contract changes

- **DELTA-Dcr-cli-001.CC1 — extend `SPEC-002.C39` with declared returns.**
  `strand help <op>` includes a `returns` field when the registry entry declares
  `:returns`. The field is the JSON-safe explanation produced by
  `skein.api.return-shape.alpha`, including per-subcommand cases and separate
  emitted-item and terminal-result cases for a streaming op. `strand help`
  continues to list summaries only.

- **DELTA-Dcr-cli-001.CC2 — keep return declarations out of the dispatcher.**
  The Go binary does not parse, validate, or interpret `:returns`. It sends the
  `help` invocation to the weaver and relays the returned JSON exactly as it does
  for arg-spec help data (TEN-006).

## DELTA-Dcr-cli-001.P3 Design decisions

### DELTA-Dcr-cli-001.D1 Full detail owns return discovery

- **Decision:** Render `:returns` only in full op detail.
- **Rationale:** Return shapes are useful when preparing or consuming one op.
  Adding them to the registry listing would make routine discovery large and
  duplicate the existing summary/detail split.
- **Rejected:** Rendering return prose in the Go client or expanding every
  no-argument help row with the full shape.

### DELTA-Dcr-cli-001.D2 Help exposes the shared explanation

- **Decision:** The help op delegates return rendering to
  `skein.api.return-shape.alpha/explain`.
- **Rationale:** Registration, tests, runtime consumption seams, and help must
  interpret one declaration. A CLI-specific translation would create a second
  return language.
- **Rejected:** Storing a separate hand-authored help projection beside
  `:returns`.

## DELTA-Dcr-cli-001.P4 Open questions

None.
