## PLAN-Dcr-001.P1 Goal and scope

Add declared op return contracts beside arg-specs, render them in live help, and
check captured op outputs in CI without adding live-path validation. Reuse the
same evaluator at the agent-run-to-workflow consumption seam. Add one exact
four-field entity constructor and adopt it where the proposal found hand-written
copies. The approved proposal and review synthesis `m5qvz` fix the design
boundary; this plan supplies the build order and test boundary.

## PLAN-Dcr-001.P2 Approach

- **PLAN-Dcr-001.A1 — one public return language:** Add the pure
  `skein.api.return-shape.alpha` namespace with `validate!`, `explain`, and
  `check!`. The finite inline language has scalar leaves, scalar nullability,
  closed maps with required/optional keys and an explicit extra-value shape,
  and homogeneous sequential collections. It has no functions, arbitrary
  predicates, general unions, named references, or recursive schemas.

- **PLAN-Dcr-001.A2 — declaration routing stays outside shapes:** A flat op uses
  one shape. A subcommand op declares one return case per arg-spec subcommand.
  A `:stream? true` case declares `:emits` and `:result` separately. Registry
  validation checks those cross-metadata invariants before publication. This
  keeps the shape evaluator small while retaining useful contracts for the
  repo's multi-verb ops.

- **PLAN-Dcr-001.A3 — declaration and help only touch registry construction:**
  Extend op metadata, registry entries, replacement, and full help. Do not add a
  check or transform around handler calls or `:op/emit!`. The test helper reads
  the selected registry declaration and checks values that owner suites already
  captured.

- **PLAN-Dcr-001.A4 — CI has an exact leaf boundary:** A return leaf is one
  successful flat-op result, one successful subcommand result, or one stream
  channel (`:emits` or `:result`). Every production op registered by the suites
  in `PLAN-Dcr-001.V2` must declare returns. Each owner suite enumerates its
  production registry entries by spool provenance and fails first on any entry
  without `:returns`. It then derives the required return-leaf set from those
  declarations and requires at least one representative captured value through
  `check-op-return!` for every leaf. No hand-maintained op or expected-leaf list
  defines the must-declare side, so a wholly undeclared production op fails the
  gate. Failure paths remain ordinary `clojure.test` failures/errors in the cold
  suite.

- **PLAN-Dcr-001.A5 — construct exact entities, declare richer rows:** Add
  `skein.api.spool.alpha/entity-projection`, which requires and returns exactly
  `id`, `title`, `state`, and `attributes`. Adopt it in Loom, the pinned kanban
  spool, and the repo kanban-tree base projection. Batteries `show` and `list`
  keep timestamps and all other current fields; their return declarations match
  those richer rows instead of using the constructor.

- **PLAN-Dcr-001.A6 — runtime checks belong at consumption adapters:** Use
  `return-shape/check!` on `agent-run/result` immediately before the subagent
  executor passes it to `workflow/complete!`. A mismatch follows the existing
  loud delivery-error path and leaves the gate incomplete. No producer write or
  unrelated stored attribute gains a runtime check.

- **PLAN-Dcr-001.A7 — merge order with `uson2`:** The sibling
  `uson2-cli-style-guide` feature lands on main before PH6-PH9 begin, and this
  branch rebases on that main. Its registered-op dispatch boundary adds
  `:operation` to declared-subcommand map results, so each declaration sweep
  captures the post-dispatch value where that rule applies. Its arg-spec
  fragment helpers are also available before those sweeps. Keep the dispatch
  boundary read-only in this feature. The `.skein/config.clj` ops hand-stamp
  `:operation` except for the flat `carder-report` and `flow-await` ops. PH9
  shapes include the hand-stamped field where present and omit it for those two
  unstamped results.

## PLAN-Dcr-001.P3 Affected areas

| ID | Area | Expected change |
| -- | ---- | --------------- |
| PLAN-Dcr-001.AA1 | `src/skein/api/return_shape/alpha.clj` | New public return-shape validator, JSON-safe explainer, and value checker. |
| PLAN-Dcr-001.AA2 | `src/skein/api/weaver/alpha.clj` | Accept, validate, retain, and explain `:returns`; ordinary invocation stays unchanged. |
| PLAN-Dcr-001.AA3 | `src/skein/test/alpha.clj` | Add the captured-value `check-op-return!` helper and structured diagnostics. |
| PLAN-Dcr-001.AA4 | `src/skein/api/spool/alpha.clj` | Add the exact four-field `entity-projection` constructor. |
| PLAN-Dcr-001.AA5 | Shipped op spools | Declare returns; adopt the entity constructor only for exact/base projections. |
| PLAN-Dcr-001.AA6 | `spools/delegation`, `spools/bench`, `spools/agent-run` | Declare repo-local op returns and check the agent-run result at the workflow consumer seam. |
| PLAN-Dcr-001.AA7 | `.skein` config and op macros | Pass `:returns`; declare repo ops; use the constructor in kanban-tree's base row. |
| PLAN-Dcr-001.AA8 | Pinned kanban spool and consumer pins | Adopt the constructor, add declarations and checks, then bump both pins. |
| PLAN-Dcr-001.AA9 | Tests, runner, and docs | Cover the new contracts and document public additions. |

## PLAN-Dcr-001.P4 Contract and migration impact

- **PLAN-Dcr-001.CM1:** The four root-spec changes are staged in the linked
  deltas. `skein.api.return-shape.alpha` is a new accretion-compatible public
  namespace; `skein.test.alpha/check-op-return!` and
  `skein.api.spool.alpha/entity-projection` accrete in existing tiers.

- **PLAN-Dcr-001.CM2:** `:returns` is optional registry metadata for downstream
  user ops, but every production op owned by this repository and every pinned
  external spool updated by this feature declares it. Malformed declarations
  fail register/replace before registry mutation.

- **PLAN-Dcr-001.CM3:** There is no data migration, persisted registry change,
  transport-version change, or live output check. Existing batteries rows keep
  their fields, including timestamps.

- **PLAN-Dcr-001.CM4:** Public namespace and helper docstring changes require
  `make api-docs`. Spool contract docs must describe declared result shapes only
  where they currently own result behavior; generated op discovery remains live
  `strand help` data.

## PLAN-Dcr-001.P5 Implementation phases

### PLAN-Dcr-001.PH1 Return-shape foundation and registry declaration

**Depends on:** none.

Outcome: `skein.api.return-shape.alpha` implements the approved scalar, map, and
collection language, including scalar-only `[:nullable <scalar>]`; finite
declaration validation; JSON-safe explanation; and path-rich value checks. Op
register/replace accepts and retains `:returns`, checks
flat/subcommand/stream alignment, and leaves invocation untouched. Add the new
test namespace to the focused runner inventory.

Cold focused gate:
`clojure -M:test skein.api.return-shape.alpha-test skein.weaver-test`.

### PLAN-Dcr-001.PH2 Full help rendering

**Depends on:** PH1.

Outcome: full `help <op>` detail renders the shared return explanation for flat,
subcommand, and streaming declarations. Help summaries, raw-envelope markers,
and arg-spec rendering retain their current contracts. The CLI remains an
opaque relay.

Cold focused gate:
`clojure -M:test skein.weaver-test skein.api.return-shape.alpha-test`.

### PLAN-Dcr-001.PH3 Author-side output check and coverage contract

**Depends on:** PH1.

Outcome: `skein.test.alpha/check-op-return!` selects the registered flat,
subcommand, emitted-item, or terminal-result shape and reports operation,
declaration, path, and actual value on mismatch. Owner-suite coverage enumerates
production ops by registry provenance, fails on missing declarations, and
derives its required leaves from the declarations under `PLAN-Dcr-001.A4`. It
does not invoke ops or become a general assertion DSL.

Cold focused gate:
`clojure -M:test skein.test.alpha-test skein.weaver-test`.

### PLAN-Dcr-001.PH4 Entity projection and exact-copy adoption

**Depends on:** none for the constructor and Loom; the external pin update
depends on the kanban upstream change.

Outcome: `skein.api.spool.alpha/entity-projection` fails on missing canonical
fields and returns exactly four keys. Loom and the repo kanban-tree base row use
it. The kanban upstream replaces the ten exact copies identified by the
proposal, passes its own focused tests, and is pinned in both synchronized
consumer files. Batteries is deliberately unchanged.

Cold focused gates:
`clojure -M:test skein.api.spool-test skein.spools.loom-test
skein.config-ops-test`; the kanban upstream runs
`clojure -M:test ct.spools.kanban-test` before the pin bump.
`make spool-suite-gate` validates the pinned kanban suite against this checkout;
it supplements, and does not replace, those cold focused gates.

### PLAN-Dcr-001.PH5 Agent-run result consumption seam

**Depends on:** PH1.

Outcome: the subagent executor checks a successful non-blank
`agent-run/result` against the shared string shape immediately before
`workflow/complete!`. A mismatch uses the existing delivery error path and
leaves the gate incomplete. Producer persistence and other delivery behavior
stay unchanged.

Cold focused gate:
`clojure -M:test skein.executors.subagent-test`.

### PLAN-Dcr-001.PH6 Core help and batteries declarations

**Depends on:** PH2, PH3, and the A7 landing precondition.

Outcome: the built-in help op and all batteries ops declare actual post-dispatch
return cases. `skein.spools.batteries-test` checks every leaf. `show` and `list`
retain and declare their richer timestamp-bearing rows.

Cold focused gate:
`clojure -M:test skein.weaver-test skein.spools.batteries-test`.

### PLAN-Dcr-001.PH7 Shipped reference-spool declarations

**Depends on:** PH2, PH3, and the A7 landing precondition.

Outcome: text-search `search`, roster and every roster subcommand,
`guild.describe`, and guild-declared test ops carry returns. Their owner suites
check every declared leaf. Guild's authoring API accepts return declarations for
dynamic ops without adding a predicate or a second schema language.

Cold focused gate:
`clojure -M:test skein.spools.text-search-test skein.roster-test
skein.guild-test`.

### PLAN-Dcr-001.PH8 Repo-local spool declarations

**Depends on:** PH2, PH3, and the A7 landing precondition.

Outcome: delegation's `agent` subcommands and bench's subcommands declare and
check every return leaf. Agent `ps` retains its domain-specific summary. No
agent-run storage or workflow payload is normalized to the four-field entity
shape.

Cold focused gate:
`clojure -M:test skein.delegation-test skein.bench-test`.

### PLAN-Dcr-001.PH9 Repo coordination and pinned-spool declarations

**Depends on:** PH2, PH3, all of PH4, and the A7 landing precondition.

Outcome: the `.skein` defop macro passes `:returns`; config, analytics, and land
ops declare and check every leaf in a focus-eligible config-op suite. The pinned
devflow and kanban op suites adopt the same contract and their synchronized
pins advance only after their focused tests pass. The config-op shapes include
their existing hand-stamped `:operation` field except for `carder-report` and
`flow-await`, whose unstamped return shapes omit it. Existing add-libs config
tests remain integration coverage, not a per-slice substitute for the focused
suite.

Cold focused gates:
`clojure -M:test skein.macros.ops-test skein.config-ops-test`; the external
spools run `clojure -M:test ct.spools.devflow-test ct.spools.kanban-test` before
pinning. Then `make spool-suite-gate` runs both pinned external suites against
this checkout.

## PLAN-Dcr-001.P6 Validation strategy

- **PLAN-Dcr-001.V1 — language and registry:**
  `skein.api.return-shape.alpha-test` covers every scalar, nullable scalar,
  required/optional and extra map fields, homogeneous collections, malformed
  declarations, paths, JSON-safe explanation, subcommands, and stream cases.
  `skein.weaver-test` covers register/replace atomic failure, retained metadata,
  full help, and the invariant that ordinary invocation does not call the
  evaluator.

- **PLAN-Dcr-001.V2 — exact CI owner suites:** The in-checkout boundary is
  `skein.weaver-test` (built-in help), `skein.spools.batteries-test` (batteries),
  `skein.spools.text-search-test` (search), `skein.roster-test` (roster),
  `skein.guild-test` (guild), `skein.delegation-test` (agent),
  `skein.bench-test` (bench), and the new focus-eligible
  `skein.config-ops-test` (config/analytics/workflows). The pinned external
  boundary is the devflow and kanban owner suites run by
  `make spool-suite-gate`. Each suite discovers its production ops from registry
  provenance and applies the declaration and leaf rules in A4; unrelated spool
  suites do not gain synthetic op coverage.

- **PLAN-Dcr-001.V3 — constructor and seam:** `skein.api.spool-test` proves
  exact keys and loud missing-field failure; `skein.spools.loom-test`,
  `skein.config-ops-test`, and the pinned kanban projection tests prove adoption
  without output narrowing. `skein.executors.subagent-test` proves valid result
  delivery and loud invalid-result non-completion.

- **PLAN-Dcr-001.V4 — per-slice gates:** Run the cold focused commands named in
  each phase. If a new test namespace is introduced, add it to the runner's
  focus-eligible inventory in the same slice. Warm results never satisfy a
  gate. Add-libs integration remains in the land suite or the pinned spool gate,
  not a reason to run the full locked suite during a worker slice.

- **PLAN-Dcr-001.V5 — docs and quality:** Regenerate API docs after public
  docstring changes. Each documentation-owning slice runs `make docs-check`; code
  slices also run the relevant formatting, lint, and reflection gates assigned
  by their task. The coordinator runs the full locked Clojure suite only at
  queue acceptance and land, followed by Go tests, smoke, and all quality gates.

## PLAN-Dcr-001.P7 Risks and open questions

- **PLAN-Dcr-001.R1 — sibling dispatch transform:** A7 closes the scheduling
  risk for the initial declaration sweep. If that landing order changes, stop
  PH6-PH9 and return the plan to architecture review; closed maps make a later
  dispatch transform a contract change.

- **PLAN-Dcr-001.R2 — external kanban/devflow coordination:** The exact kanban
  copies and both external op suites live outside this branch. The coordinator
  must arrange upstream branches/commits, run their focused suites, and update
  the paired pins atomically. Until those commits exist, PH4's pin adoption and
  PH9 cannot finish; local replacements must not be patched into the gitlibs
  cache.

- **PLAN-Dcr-001.R3 — polymorphic ops can become vague:** Falling back to
  `:json` for a whole agent, bench, roster, devflow, or kanban subcommand would
  satisfy syntax while losing drift detection. Mitigation: declare one closed
  or deliberately open shape per subcommand, use `[:nullable <scalar>]` for
  known scalar fields such as kanban-tree `:epic`, and reserve `:json` for
  genuinely dynamic leaves such as attribute values.

- **PLAN-Dcr-001.R4 — false CI coverage:** A declaration can exist without a
  checked successful example if suites merely call the helper opportunistically.
  Mitigation: owner suites enumerate every production op by registry provenance,
  fail on missing declarations, derive required leaves from the declarations,
  and retain one checked representative per leaf under A4/V2.

- **PLAN-Dcr-001.Q1 (resolved):** The public namespace is
  `skein.api.return-shape.alpha`. The CLI layer delegates explanation to it.

- **PLAN-Dcr-001.Q2 (resolved):** Batteries `show` and `list` retain their
  richer rows, including timestamps. The entity constructor does not narrow
  them.

## PLAN-Dcr-001.P8 Task context

- **PLAN-Dcr-001.TC1:** The proposal is approved and review synthesis `m5qvz` is
  binding. Do not reopen the public namespace, minimal-language, richer
  batteries, or constructor-tier choices.

- **PLAN-Dcr-001.TC2:** Shape declarations are finite inline EDN. Map shapes are
  closed unless `:extra` is explicit. Keep `:json` at dynamic leaves; do not add
  functions, arbitrary predicates, recursive references, unions beyond
  scalar-only nullability, coercion, or defaults while declaring complex ops.

- **PLAN-Dcr-001.TC3:** Registration failure must be atomic for register and
  replace. Help uses the shared explainer. Ordinary `op!` and `:op/emit!` do not
  call the checker. The subagent executor is the only runtime consumer seam in
  this feature.

- **PLAN-Dcr-001.TC4:** One checked example is required for every flat result,
  subcommand result, and stream channel in the owner suites enumerated by V2.
  Registry provenance, not a hand-maintained list, defines the production ops
  that must declare returns. Negative-path tests do not count as return
  coverage.

- **PLAN-Dcr-001.TC5:** `entity-projection` belongs in
  `skein.api.spool.alpha`. Its output is exactly four fields. It may be the base
  for an explicitly richer row, but batteries and domain-specific summaries do
  not lose fields to adopt it.

- **PLAN-Dcr-001.TC6:** Keep the kanban pin in `deps.edn` and
  `.skein/spools.edn` identical. Never edit the tools.deps/gitlibs cache.
  Validate the upstream commit before advancing either pin.

- **PLAN-Dcr-001.TC7:** Use each phase's cold focused test namespaces. The full
  locked suite is coordinator-only at queue acceptance and land.

- **PLAN-Dcr-001.TC8:** The task queue maps Tasks 1-9 directly to PH1-PH9.
  Tasks 1, 3, and 5 use `sol-med` for the shape validator, CI coverage gate,
  and spool-to-spool seam. The remaining phases use `sol-low`. Every task is
  AFK; PH6-PH9 carry A7 as a dispatch precondition rather than a HITL task.

## PLAN-Dcr-001.P9 Developer Notes

Append notes here. Do not rewrite earlier notes.

### PLAN-Dcr-001.DN1 Spec and plan authoring — 2026-07-14

- Staged four root-spec deltas and this plan under strand `qyonr`. The CI
  boundary is the exact return-leaf rule in A4 over the owner suites in V2.
  Added `skein.config-ops-test` as a focus-eligible owner suite because the
  existing `skein.config-test` is an add-libs shard and cannot serve as a cold
  focused slice gate. External kanban/devflow changes and the `uson2` merge
  order require coordinator scheduling before declaration sweeps finish.

### PLAN-Dcr-001.DN2 Architecture review fixes — 2026-07-14

- Recorded the fixed sibling landing order for every declaration sweep. Changed
  CI coverage to enumerate production registry provenance before deriving
  leaves. Added scalar-only nullability for known typed nils. Ordered PH9 after
  all of PH4 because both phases edit `.skein/config.clj`.

### PLAN-Dcr-001.DN3 AFK queue transcription — 2026-07-14

- Transcribed one task per implementation phase without changing phase edges.
  External upstream work stays inside PH4 and PH9; coordinators provide those
  checkouts before dispatch, and workers validate upstream commits before
  advancing synchronized pins.

### PLAN-Dcr-001.DN4 PH2 generated API drift — 2026-07-15

- Task 2 changed the public `help` docstring but its contract did not include
  the generated Weaver API page or an API-doc gate. Task 3's strict docs gate
  exposed the drift. The Task 3 retry was narrowly authorized to regenerate
  and commit `docs/api/weaver.api.md` before sign-off.
