**Reading context:** this proposal assumes the Skein vocabulary (strands, edges, relations, spools, batteries surface,
spool-state, install-time activation) defined in `docs/skein.md`, `docs/writing-shared-spools.md`, and the spool READMEs,
and the devflow document chain: brief (scope contract) → this proposal's C-clauses (design contract) → `PLAN-Vr-001` slices
(sequencing) → `TASK-Vr-*` files (execution contracts). Every point ID is a grepable anchor. Source citations name a stable
site — a function or op (e.g. `spawn-run!` in `skein.spools.agent-run`) — and treat that name as the load-bearing reference.
Any `file:line` is secondary: as verified at authoring in the `vocab-registry` worktree (forked from `main@bd49eb2`; F1–F3
landed) and not durable, since line numbers move as nearby code moves.

## PROP-Vr-001.P1 Problem

Attribute namespaces and edge types are conventions with no machine-readable record. Three costs follow, all of them
already anticipated by the strand-model spec, which states that "ownership is registered in the runtime, not encoded in the
key" (`strand-model.md:34`) — a registry that does not yet exist.

- **Discovery is doc-first.** Finding that `review/*`, `gate/*`, or `panel/*` exists requires reading the right spool doc
  first. The spool sources write them — `review/target`/`review/roster`/`review/pass` (`delegation.clj:1071-1073`),
  `panel/seat`/`panel/turn` (`delegation.clj:1320-1321`), `gate/run-id`/`gate/delivered`
  (`subagent.clj:98,103`) — but nothing enumerates the settled families for a cold agent.
- **Strays live undetected.** A key belonging to no declared vocabulary (the pre-F3 bare `notes`/`note`/`verify-note`
  shapes are the worked example, resolved by `PROP-Np-001`) can sit in live data for weeks. Carder reports stale, orphan,
  and failure-blocked strands (`carder.clj:191`) but has no section for "this attribute belongs to no declared vocabulary,"
  so a stray namespace is invisible to hygiene.
- **Nothing guards ownership.** Two spools can claim the same namespace with different meanings and nothing objects at
  install. The engine already fails loudly when a second process double-publishes the ambient runtime; there is no
  equivalent guard for a namespace claim.

The adjacent surfaces that *look* like a registry are not one. `skein.api.relations.alpha` ships a source-visible advisory
catalog of edge relations — `catalog` data plus `relation`/`operational-relations`/`annotation-relations` lookups
(`alpha.clj:8,72,77,82`) — but it is a static `def`, edge-types only, with no owner field and no install-time claim.
Selvage ships a per-runtime vocabulary registry (`defvocab!`/`vocabs`, `selvage.clj:97,111`) but it lints attribute
*values* against `:enum`/`:kind`/`:required-with` checks and replaces on duplicate name; it records no ownership and raises
nothing on a collision. Neither answers "who owns `review/*`, and does this live attribute belong to any declared
vocabulary."

## PROP-Vr-001.P2 Goals

- **PROP-Vr-001.G1:** One runtime-owned registry of vocabulary declarations — attribute namespaces and edge types — each
  carrying an owner, its keys/direction, and a doc. Guidance, not a schema: it records what is declared, it does not gate
  writes (TEN-002/TEN-004).
- **PROP-Vr-001.G2:** Spools declare at install through their existing `install!` path, so the registered surface is
  derived from installed code and can never drift from a hand-maintained list.
- **PROP-Vr-001.G3:** One read verb — `strand vocab` — lists every declared vocabulary, solving "you need to know the other
  things exist first."
- **PROP-Vr-001.G4:** Two opt-in consumers reuse the declarations without new enforcement: selvage can cross-check its
  value-vocabularies against declared ownership, and a carder hygiene section flags attributes in live data belonging to no
  declared vocabulary — the check that would have surfaced the bare-`notes` strays within a day.
- **PROP-Vr-001.G5:** Exactly one hard edge (TEN-003): registering a namespace another owner already holds fails loudly at
  install, mechanically like the runtime's double-publish guard.
- **PROP-Vr-001.G6:** Purely additive. No migration, no data rewrite, no cutover, no weaver restart; a `.skein` config
  change is picked up by `reload!` per the pickup ladder (PROP-Vr-001.C12).

## PROP-Vr-001.P3 Non-goals

- **PROP-Vr-001.NG1:** No enforcement beyond the duplicate-owner install failure. Undeclared attributes still write fine
  (TEN-002/TEN-004); the carder hygiene section surfaces them, nothing blocks them. This is the design center — see
  PROP-Vr-001.C13.
- **PROP-Vr-001.NG2:** No new storage. The registry is in-memory runtime state (like every other registry and like
  selvage's vocabularies), not a table. Declarations are derived from installed code, not durable user data
  (PROP-Vr-001.C2).
- **PROP-Vr-001.NG3:** No second edge catalog. The edge-type dimension is seeded from `relations.alpha`'s existing catalog,
  not re-listed (PROP-Vr-001.C5).
- **PROP-Vr-001.NG4:** No change to selvage's value-linting model. Selvage keeps declaring `:enum`/`:kind`/`:required-with`
  checks; this feature only lets it *reference* the ownership registry (PROP-Vr-001.C7).
- **PROP-Vr-001.NG5:** No value validation in the registry itself. It records that a namespace is owned; it does not know or
  check what values its keys may hold (that is selvage's job).

## PROP-Vr-001.P4 Approach

The work is a set of design clauses (C1..C13). C1 fixes the declaration shape; C2 places the registry; C3 defines `declare!`
and the one hard edge; C4 the queryable read; C5 the seed (edges from `relations.alpha`, attr namespaces from each owning
spool's `install!`); C6 the `strand vocab` verb; C7–C8 the two opt-in consumers; C9 the third-party prefix convention; C10
spec/doc deltas; C11 the alpha-surface disposition; C12 atomic additive landing and the pickup ladder; C13 what is
deliberately not built. Each clause names the exact call sites it touches so the plan can be verified against the tree.

## PROP-Vr-001.C1 — the vocabulary declaration shape

A declaration is a data map, modelled on the `relations.alpha` catalog entry shape (`alpha.clj:11-15`) and extended with the
two fields that catalog lacks — `:owner` and, for namespaces, `:keys`:

```clojure
{:kind      :attr-namespace          ; or :edge
 :name      "review"                 ; the namespace segment, or the edge-type name
 :owner     :skein/spools-agents     ; the module-use key of the declaring spool (init.clj)
 :keys      ["review/target" "review/roster" "review/pass"]  ; known keys, :attr-namespace only
 :doc       "Review pass bookkeeping written by the delegation review flow."}
```

- **`:kind`** is `:attr-namespace` or `:edge`. Namespaces name the concept, never the spool (`strand-model.md:34`); the owner
  is a separate field, exactly as the spec prescribes.
- **`:owner`** is the declaring module's use-key (the keyword `init.clj` registers with, e.g. `:skein/spools-agents`). It is
  the collision key for the hard edge (C3) and the attribution shown by `strand vocab` (C6).
- **`:keys`** enumerates the known keys of an `:attr-namespace` (advisory — a namespace may grow keys the declaration has not
  caught up with; the carder consumer flags by *namespace*, not by exact key, so an undeclared key under a declared
  namespace is not a stray). Omitted for `:edge`, which is a single relation name.
- **`:doc`** is a one-line human note, mirroring `relations.alpha`'s `:help`.

Edge declarations additionally carry the `relations.alpha` fields (`:family`, `:direction`, `:declared-acyclic?`) because
they are seeded from that catalog verbatim (C5); the registry adds `:owner` and `:kind :edge` around them.

## PROP-Vr-001.C2 — the registry and its home

A new blessed namespace **`skein.api.vocab.alpha`** owns the registry (Q1, adopted at sign-off). Rationale:

- The declarations are cross-spool guidance data owned by the runtime, not by any one spool: agent-run, delegation, kanban,
  workflow, and roster each declare into it. Housing it inside a reference spool's internals would force the other spools to
  depend on that spool's internals — the same argument that placed the note primitive in `skein.api.notes.alpha` rather than
  in agent-run (`PROP-Np-001.Q2`).
- It reuses the `relations.alpha` advisory-catalog *idiom* — a vector of declaration maps plus by-name and by-dimension
  lookups — rather than inventing a second registry shape (the brief's "generalize that pattern" instruction). What it adds
  over `relations.alpha` is what that static `def` cannot provide: dynamic install-time registration, an owner field, and a
  duplicate-owner failure.

The backing store is per-runtime state via `runtime/spool-state` (`runtime.alpha.clj:251`), the same mechanism selvage uses
for its vocabularies (`selvage.clj:28-29`). It is versioned per the shape-drift discipline (`selvage.clj:16-22`,
`docs/writing-shared-spools.md` "Versioned spool state"): a `state-version` next to the `new-state` builder, pinned by a
`skein.spools.test-support/assert-state-shape` drift test, so a post-upgrade reload reinits rather than reusing a
shape-mismatched map. This is in-memory only — no new table, no migration (NG2).

## PROP-Vr-001.C3 — `declare!` and the one hard edge

`(vocab/declare! runtime declaration)` validates the C1 shape (fail loud on unknown/missing keys via
`skein.spools.util/reject-unknown-keys!`/`fail!`, the selvage pattern at `selvage.clj:60-95`) and records it under
`[:kind :name]`. It carries the sole enforcement in the feature:

- **The hard edge (G5, TEN-003).** If `[:kind :name]` is already held by a *different* `:owner`, `declare!` throws `ex-info`
  with `:name`, `:kind`, `:existing-owner`, and `:declaring-owner`. Because each owning spool calls `declare!` from its
  `install!`, this throw propagates through the module `:call` and aborts activation loudly — mechanically the same posture
  as the runtime's atomic double-publish guard (a second claim of an owned slot fails, it does not silently win).
- **Idempotent for the same owner.** Re-declaring `[:kind :name]` with the *same* `:owner` replaces the entry and does not
  throw. This is required, not incidental: `reload!` re-runs every `install!` (`runtime.alpha.clj:30`), and `spool-state`
  survives reload (`runtime.alpha.clj:251`), so an owner re-declaring its own namespaces on reload must be a no-op-shaped
  replace, never a self-collision. The collision is strictly cross-owner. This spool-state reload model is Q2, adopted.

"Fails loudly at install" therefore means: the declaring spool's `install!` raises, the `use!` activation for that module
fails, and cold start / `reload!` surfaces the conflicting-owner data — no sensible default, no last-writer-wins.

## PROP-Vr-001.C4 — the queryable read surface

`skein.api.vocab.alpha` exposes read functions modelled on `relations.alpha`'s `relation`/`operational-relations`/
`annotation-relations` trio (`alpha.clj:72-85`):

- **`(vocab/declarations runtime)`** — all declarations, sorted deterministically (by `[:kind :name]`), each the full C1 map.
- **`(vocab/declarations runtime {:kind :attr-namespace})`** / `{:kind :edge}` — one dimension.
- **`(vocab/declaration runtime kind name)`** — the entry for one namespace or edge, or `nil` when undeclared (matching
  `relations.alpha/relation` returning `nil` for an uncataloged name — an undeclared namespace is still a valid userland
  namespace, NG1).

All take `runtime` as the first argument (the shared-spool discipline, `docs/writing-shared-spools.md` rule 1); there is no
ambient-singleton path.

## PROP-Vr-001.C5 — the seed

Two sources, no duplication.

- **Edges are seeded from `relations.alpha` (NG3).** At its own `install!`, `vocab.alpha` reads `relations.alpha/catalog`
  and wraps each entry as an `:edge` declaration owned by `:skein/core` (the shipped engine set — the one owner that is not
  a spool use-key), preserving `:family`/`:direction`/`:declared-acyclic?`. `relations.alpha` stays the single source of
  shipped-edge truth (depends-on, parent-of, supersedes, serves, notes as operational acyclic; related-to, duplicates,
  references, implements, verifies, tracks, caused-by as annotation), and `vocab.alpha` reflects it rather than re-listing
  it. This keeps the edge vocabulary from forking (Q3, adopted).
- **Attribute namespaces are declared by each owning spool's `install!`.** Each spool that writes a durable namespace calls
  `vocab/declare!` from its existing `install!`, owned by that module's use-key from `.skein/init.clj`. The confirmed core
  seed carries exactly one owner per namespace, each pinned to a real write site in this tree:

  | Namespace | Owner (init.clj use-key) | Declaring module | Write site (stable ref; line as-verified) |
  | --- | --- | --- | --- |
  | `agent-run/*` | `:skein/spools-shuttle` | `skein.spools.agent-run` | `spawn-run!` reserves the control attrs (`agent_run.clj:1611`) |
  | `gate/*` | `:skein/spools-treadle` | `skein.spools.executors.subagent` | `deliver-run!`/`spawn-for-gate!` stamp `gate/*` (`subagent.clj:114,184`) |
  | `review/*` | `:skein/spools-agents` | `skein.spools.delegation` | `roster-review-specs` builds the `review/*` attrs (`delegation.clj:1071-1073`) |
  | `panel/*` | `:skein/spools-agents` | `skein.spools.delegation` | `panel-specs` writes `panel/seat`/`panel/turn` (`delegation.clj:1320-1321`) |
  | `kanban/*` | `:skein/spools-kanban` | `skein.spools.kanban` | `add!` writes `card-attributes` (`kanban.clj:150`; builder `:85`) |
  | `workflow/*` | `:skein/spools-workflow` | `skein.spools.workflow` | `step-strand`/molecule build inside `compile` (`workflow.clj:518,771`) |
  | `roster/*` | `:skein/spools-roster` | `skein.spools.roster` | `track-attributes` builds the entry attrs (`roster.clj:97`) |

  Each owner is the single module whose `install!` declares the namespace. The subagent gate executor
  (`:skein/spools-treadle`) owns `gate/*` even though its source sits in the agent-run package: the activation module, not
  the file location, is the owner. `gate/*` is the treadle-era survivor the brief keeps (Q4, adopted); any residual survivor
  is enumerated from the live tree at implementation, not guessed here. Namespaces that surfaced in a naive grep but are
  *not* durable strand attributes — `peer/*` (error codes, `peers/alpha.clj`), `batch/*` and `mutation/*` (event payload
  keys, `chime.clj`/`graph/alpha.clj`), `handle/*` (in-memory run backend handles written under `agent-run/handle.*`,
  `agent_run.clj`) — are deliberately excluded from the seed.

  **Resolve at implementation (not in the confirmed seed).** Two brief-named namespaces cannot be pinned to a single
  `.skein/init.clj` use-key from this tree. Because a duplicate/ambiguous owner is the feature's one hard edge (C3), the
  seed must not encode the ambiguity; the planner declares each only once its open point is closed:

  | Namespace | Written by (this tree) | Open point to resolve |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | `note/*` | core `note!` in `skein.api.notes.alpha` (`notes/alpha.clj:73-76`) | Core F3 code with no spool use-key: decide whether the batteries `note` op declares it under `:skein/spools-batteries` or core declares a `:skein/core`-owned entry at `notes.alpha` activation. |
  | `devflow/*` | not written here — external `codethread/devflow` spool; this repo only reads it (`roster.clj:420,424`) | The external spool declares its own namespace under `:skein/spools-devflow` from *its* `install!`; nothing in this feature seeds it, so confirm the external declaration rather than adding a core row. |

## PROP-Vr-001.C6 — the `strand vocab` read verb

`strand vocab` registers as one new batteries read op, the note/notes precedent (`batteries.clj:462-476`; F3 showed a
batteries op needs no `cli.md` delta, `SPEC-Np-003`). It joins `op-registrations`:

- `['vocab vocab-arg-spec :read 'skein.spools.batteries/vocab-op]` — flag `--kind` (`attr-namespace`|`edge`, optional);
  delegates to `skein.api.vocab.alpha/declarations`. It reads the runtime from `:op/runtime` like every other batteries op
  (`batteries.clj:330,336`).

JSON output is an ordered array of declaration maps (the C1 shape, string-keyed at the wire boundary), optionally narrowed
by `--kind`. Batteries is a classpath-shipped reference spool whose contract is `spools/batteries.md` (SPEC-005.C3), so the
verb is in-contract through that doc; the per-command entry is added there (C10). This is the only CLI surface the feature
adds — declaration is a trusted install-time action, not a CLI verb (TEN-006). Batteries op, not a `.skein` config op, is
Q5, adopted.

## PROP-Vr-001.C7 — selvage consumer (opt-in cross-check)

Selvage keeps its value-linting model unchanged (NG4). This feature adds one opt-in read: selvage can list the declared
attribute namespaces (`vocab/declarations runtime {:kind :attr-namespace}`) and cross-check that each vocabulary it lints
names a *declared* namespace — surfacing a selvage vocabulary that lints keys nobody owns, and vice versa. This is a new
read-only helper on the selvage surface (e.g. `selvage/undeclared-checks` returning the checks whose `:attr` namespace has
no declaration), registered nowhere by default; it is composition sugar over `check`/`vocabs`, not a new enforcement path.
It reuses `vocab.alpha` explicit-runtime reads and adds no watch behaviour.

## PROP-Vr-001.C8 — carder consumer (undeclared-namespace hygiene)

Carder gains one report section, in the shape of its existing sections (`carder.clj:191-207`): **undeclared** — active
strands carrying an attribute whose namespace segment is declared by nobody. It reads `vocab/declarations runtime
{:kind :attr-namespace}` for the declared set, walks active strands (the `active-strands` path, `carder.clj:72-76`), and
flags each strand → attribute key whose namespace is absent from the declared set. It flags by *namespace*, not exact key
(C1: a declaration's `:keys` are advisory), so `review/newfield` under declared `review/*` is clean while a bare
`verify-note` or an unowned `frobnicate/*` is flagged. It is read-only (carder mutates nothing, `carder.clj:8`) and joins
`report` as a fourth section alongside `stale`/`orphans`/`blocked-by-failure`. This is the check that would have caught the
bare-`notes` strays within a day (brief §3).

## PROP-Vr-001.C9 — third-party prefix convention

The rule that third-party spools qualify their attribute namespaces with a project prefix already exists in prose
(`strand-model.md:34`). This feature lands the *authoring* rule where spool authors read it: a short subsection in
`docs/writing-shared-spools.md` stating that a shared spool declares its namespaces (via `vocab/declare!` from its
`install!`), qualifies them with a project prefix (`acme/…`) so they never collide with core or another author's
namespaces, and that a colliding claim fails loudly at install (C3). No enforcement of the prefix itself — it is convention
backed by the duplicate-owner edge, consistent with the guidance-not-enforcement center (NG1).

## PROP-Vr-001.C10 — spec and doc deltas

- **`devflow/specs/strand-model.md`** (`:34`, attribute-namespace prose): the sentence "ownership is registered in the
  runtime, not encoded in the key" gains a concrete referent — name `skein.api.vocab.alpha` as the runtime registry that
  records ownership, and note the third-party-prefix rule is backed by its duplicate-owner install failure. The relations
  advisory-catalog paragraph (`:56`) gains one line noting `vocab.alpha` reflects the edge catalog as owned `:edge`
  declarations.
- **`docs/writing-shared-spools.md`**: the third-party prefix subsection (C9) and a note that a shared spool declares its
  vocabulary from `install!`.
- **`spools/batteries.md`**: the per-command contract for `strand vocab` (C6), following the existing command entries.
- **`spools/selvage.md`** and **`spools/carder.md`**: the new opt-in helper (C7) and the undeclared hygiene section (C8) in
  each spool's Surface table — repo-local reference-spool docs, their own cadence (SPEC-005.C3).
- **`devflow/specs/alpha-surface.md`**: SPEC-005.C2's enumerated blessed set gains `skein.api.vocab.alpha` (C11).

## PROP-Vr-001.C11 — alpha-surface disposition

- **`skein.api.vocab.alpha`** (C2) is a new blessed spool-facing namespace — added to SPEC-005.C2's enumerated set
  (`alpha-surface.md:12`), accretion-compatible within its subnamespace, exactly the disposition `skein.api.notes.alpha`
  took in F3 (`PROP-Np-001.C12`, `SPEC-Np-002`).
- **The edge seed from `relations.alpha`** (C5) touches only reads of that already-blessed namespace (SPEC-005.C2); nothing
  in `relations.alpha` changes, so its catalog test (`relations_test.clj:6`) is untouched.
- **`strand vocab`** (C6) is a batteries op, in-contract via `spools/batteries.md` (SPEC-005.C3), not the alpha index.
- **selvage and carder** (C7/C8) are classpath reference spools in-contract via their docs (SPEC-005.C3); their surfaces
  accrete one helper each.
- No `skein.core.*` change: the registry is runtime spool-state, not storage init, so there is no `db.clj` delta and no
  strand-model storage-semantics change (contrast `notes`, which needed a `db.clj` acyclic declaration).

## PROP-Vr-001.C12 — atomic additive landing and the pickup ladder

- **PROP-Vr-001.R-additive — one landing, no cutover.** The namespace, the seed declarations, the `strand vocab` verb, and
  the two consumer helpers land together. There is no data migration, no rewrite, and no historical concern (the registry
  reads installed code, not stored strands), so unlike F3 there is no separate signed cutover step.
- **Pickup ladder.** New Clojure namespaces and the batteries op arrive with the JVM/spool load; the Go CLI change for
  `strand vocab` needs only `make build` (a batteries op is registered arg-spec data, not new Go dispatch). If the `.skein`
  world's own config declares a namespace (a repo-policy vocabulary), that config change is picked up by
  `runtime-alpha/reload!` — no weaver restart, because nothing changes at the JVM/transport level. Smoke-test any `.skein`
  config change in a disposable world first.
- **PROP-Vr-001.R-reload.** The one reload subtlety is C3's idempotent-same-owner requirement: `reload!` re-runs every
  `install!` against a surviving `spool-state` registry, so same-owner re-declaration must replace, not collide. This is a
  design invariant of `declare!`, tested directly (P6).

## PROP-Vr-001.C13 — deliberately not built

- **No write-time enforcement.** Undeclared attributes and edges still write and read exactly as today. The registry is
  guidance; the carder section surfaces strays, nothing blocks them (TEN-002/TEN-004, NG1). This is the design center: the
  system stays malleable, and the only place it refuses is the cross-owner install claim (C3).
- **No value schema.** The registry records ownership of a namespace, not the shape of its values. Value invariants remain
  selvage's opt-in `:enum`/`:kind`/`:required-with` checks (NG5); the registry and selvage compose (C7) but neither absorbs
  the other.
- **No durable storage of declarations.** They are in-memory runtime state rebuilt from installed code every load (NG2). A
  declaration is never authority the way a strand attribute is; the code that declared it is the record (PHILOSOPHY: the
  code wins).

## PROP-Vr-001.P5 Sequencing and risks

- **PROP-Vr-001.R1 — same-owner reload collision.** The largest correctness risk is C3's idempotency: if `declare!` treated
  a same-owner re-declaration as a collision, every `reload!` (and the second cold-start pass in some flows) would abort
  activation. Mitigation: the collision is defined strictly cross-owner and is the first tested case (P6).
- **PROP-Vr-001.R2 — seed/owner accuracy.** A wrong `:owner` on a seed namespace would mislead `strand vocab` and could
  create a phantom collision if two spools both claim it. Mitigation: each namespace is declared from the single spool that
  writes it, owner = that spool's use-key, with the write site verified (C5 table); the treadle-era survivor set is
  enumerated from the live tree at implementation, not guessed (Q4).
- **PROP-Vr-001.R3 — carder false positives.** Flagging by exact key rather than namespace would flag every legitimate new
  key under a declared namespace. Mitigation: C8 flags by namespace segment; a declaration's `:keys` are advisory (C1).
- **PROP-Vr-001.R4 — state-shape drift.** `spool-state` survives reload, so a later shape change to the registry map could
  silently reuse a stale value. Mitigation: the versioned-state discipline (C2) with a `state-version` and an
  `assert-state-shape` drift test, exactly as selvage does (`selvage.clj:16-22`).

## PROP-Vr-001.P6 Validation gates

All green in one landing:

- `make build`
- `flock -w 3600 /tmp/skein-test.lock clojure -M:test` (new: `vocab.alpha` registry tests — declare/query, cross-owner
  collision throws, same-owner idempotent, seed reflects `relations.alpha`; selvage cross-check helper; carder undeclared
  section; the `assert-state-shape` drift test)
- `(cd cli && go test ./...)`
- `clojure -M:smoke`
- `make fmt-check lint reflect-check docs-check` (held at zero findings)
- `make api-docs` — clean regen; `git status --short` shows only the expected `spools/*.api.md` changes for the touched
  spools (batteries, selvage, carder) plus the new `vocab.api.md` if a `vocab` doc is added
- `git status --short` clean of generated SQLite and runtime metadata artifacts

## PROP-Vr-001.P7 Done-when

- **PROP-Vr-001.DW1:** `skein.api.vocab.alpha` exists and is in SPEC-005.C2; `declare!` records a C1 declaration, throws on
  a cross-owner claim, and is idempotent for the same owner; `declarations`/`declaration` read it with explicit runtime.
- **PROP-Vr-001.DW2:** The seed is live — `strand vocab` lists the confirmed F1–F3 attribute namespaces (agent-run, gate,
  review, panel, kanban, workflow, roster), each with a single owner, plus the edge types reflected from `relations.alpha`;
  `note/*` and `devflow/*` are declared once their resolve-at-implementation owner (C5) is closed. The edge set is not
  duplicated in `vocab.alpha` source (Q3).
- **PROP-Vr-001.DW3:** `strand vocab` exists as a batteries read op with `--kind`, contracted in `spools/batteries.md`.
- **PROP-Vr-001.DW4:** Carder's report carries an `undeclared` section flagging active strands with an attribute in no
  declared namespace; selvage exposes the opt-in cross-check helper. Neither blocks any write (NG1).
- **PROP-Vr-001.DW5:** The third-party prefix authoring rule is in `docs/writing-shared-spools.md`, backed by the C3
  duplicate-owner failure; `strand-model.md:34/:56` name the registry.
- **PROP-Vr-001.DW6:** All P6 gates green in one atomic, additive landing — no migration, no cutover, no weaver restart.

## PROP-Vr-001.P8 Design decisions

Zero open questions: Q1–Q5 were decided at proposal sign-off and folded into the C-clauses named below. This section keeps
each question, its adopted resolution, and the rationale for the record.

- **PROP-Vr-001.Q1 — registry home (resolved).** New `skein.api.vocab.alpha`, fold into `relations.alpha`, or keep it as
  selvage-adjacent spool state? **Resolution (adopted): new `skein.api.vocab.alpha` (folded into C2).** It is cross-spool
  guidance data owned by the runtime (same argument that gave notes its own namespace), it needs owner-stamped install-time
  registration and a duplicate-owner failure that `relations.alpha`'s static `def` cannot carry, and folding it into a
  reference spool would force other spools onto that spool's internals. It reuses `relations.alpha`'s catalog idiom rather
  than inventing a second one, so "generalize, don't reinvent" is honoured at the API-shape level.
- **PROP-Vr-001.Q2 — reload model: spool-state vs a reload-cleared registry (resolved).** The registry could survive reload
  (`spool-state`) or be cleared and rebuilt on each `reload!` like the op/view registries. **Resolution (adopted):
  `spool-state` with versioned shape and idempotent same-owner `declare!` (folded into C2 and C3).** It needs no new core
  registry surface (Less is More), matches selvage exactly, and the only cost — same-owner re-declaration on reload — is
  handled by the C3 idempotency rule and a test. A reload-cleared registry would remove that subtlety but adds core surface
  for an advisory store; not worth it.
- **PROP-Vr-001.Q3 — edge declarations: seed from `relations.alpha` or re-declare in `vocab.alpha`? (resolved).**
  **Resolution (adopted): seed (reflect) from `relations.alpha` (folded into C5).** One source of shipped-edge truth, no
  fork; `vocab.alpha` wraps each catalog entry as an owned `:edge` declaration at its install. If a future spool needs to
  declare a *new* edge type with ownership, `vocab/declare!` accepts `:kind :edge` directly — the seed path and the declare
  path coexist.
- **PROP-Vr-001.Q4 — treadle-era survivor seed set (resolved).** The brief keeps "the treadle-era survivors" but names only
  families by example. **Resolution (adopted): seed the confirmed families (corrected C5 table, chiefly `gate/*` owned by
  `:skein/spools-treadle`) and enumerate any residual survivor from the live `.skein` world at implementation (folded into
  C5).** This mirrors F3 measuring its rewrite counts at cutover time rather than hardcoding the brief's stale figures. The
  planner treats the C5 confirmed seed as the core and the residual sweep as a bounded implementation step.
- **PROP-Vr-001.Q5 — where `strand vocab` lives: batteries op or `.skein` config op? (resolved).** **Resolution (adopted):
  batteries op (folded into C6)**, the note/notes precedent — the registry is engine-owned guidance data, so its read verb
  belongs with the shipped reference surface, not repo-local config. `SPEC-Np-003` established a batteries op needs no
  `cli.md` delta.
