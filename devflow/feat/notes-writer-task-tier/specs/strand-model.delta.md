# Strand model delta for notes-writer-task-tier

**Document ID:** `DELTA-Nwt-001`
**Root spec:** [strand-model.md](../../../specs/strand-model.md)
**Feature:** [../proposal.md](../proposal.md)
**Status:** Reviewed
**Last Updated:** 2026-07-10

## DELTA-Nwt-001.P1 Summary

Accretes a notes *writer* value onto the blessed `skein.api.notes.alpha` surface
(SPEC-001, SPEC-005.C2) beside the untouched `note!`/`notes` primitive: a writer
carries a note target (or a thunk resolving one), a default decoration, and an
author; it serializes to a plain-data ref that ships into subprocesses; and it
renders through a single prompt fragment. Adds the open `note/kind` attribute
vocabulary. Records two scope judgments — the CLI decoration passthrough and the
kanban task tier — that this feature lands in spool docs, not the root specs.

## DELTA-Nwt-001.P2 Contract changes

- **DELTA-Nwt-001.C1 (writer value):** `skein.api.notes.alpha` accretes a writer
  constructor `(writer runtime target-or-thunk {:keys [decoration by]})`
  returning a writer value. `target-or-thunk` is a strand-id string or a 0-arg fn
  returning one (the target may not exist at construction time). `:decoration` is
  a map of string attr-key → string value defaulted onto every write; `:by` is
  the default author. Construction validates these shapes and fails loudly.
  `note!`/`notes` signatures are unchanged (SPEC-005.C2 accretion,
  PROP-Nwt-001.NG2); the writer wraps `note!`, the low-level primitive.

- **DELTA-Nwt-001.C2 (write!):** `(write! w text {:keys [decoration by round]})`
  appends a note through `note!`. Per-call `:decoration` shallow-merges per key
  OVER the writer default; per-call `:by` overrides the writer default; `:round`
  passes through. A thunk target resolves at each `write!`; a missing or deleted
  target fails loudly with the existing "Note target strand not found"
  (SPEC-001.P5).

- **DELTA-Nwt-001.C3 (writer-ref):** `(writer-ref w)` returns the plain-data ref
  `{:target <resolved id> :decoration <merged map> :by <author>}`. A thunk
  resolves exactly once, at ref time, and the ref freezes that id; refs ship into
  subprocesses, so late rebinding across a process boundary is out of scope.
  There is deliberately no `ref->writer`: the constructor already reconstructs —
  `(writer runtime (:target ref) {:decoration (:decoration ref) :by (:by ref)})` —
  and the surface is accretion-only, so no sugar ships without a named consumer.
  Every surface consuming a ref or per-call `:decoration` validates the shape and
  fails loudly naming the offending field; malformed refs never write silently.

- **DELTA-Nwt-001.C4 (single prompt renderer):** `(writer-ref->prompt ref)` is
  the one renderer of the note-writing instruction fragment ("append notes with:
  `<cmd> agent note <target> "<text>" --by <author> --attr k=v …`"). It is the
  single source for that fragment; every prompt site that today hand-builds an
  `agent note <id>` string converges on it. Routing is guidance, not enforcement
  (TEN-002, PROP-Nwt-001.NG3): the writer shapes prompts and centralizes the
  convention; a remote agent may still note any id it knows.

- **DELTA-Nwt-001.C5 (non-goal — no ctx-dispatch routing):** The blessed writer
  surface adds no ctx-dispatch routing. Route fns cannot render into a prompt and
  would reintroduce the silent card-fallback failure mode (PROP-Nwt-001.NG1,
  settled 2026-07-10); routing composition stays in trusted glue as plain
  function composition.

- **DELTA-Nwt-001.C6 (note/kind vocabulary):** The blessed note shape
  (SPEC-001.P5) accretes an optional `note/kind` decorating attribute, declared in
  the vocab registry under the core `note` namespace as an open, guidance-only
  set: `"activity"` (progress log), `"decision"` (durable choice and why),
  `"review-dump"` (bulk findings), `"summary"` (run/session wrap-up). Views may
  fold or filter by kind; an absent `note/kind` reads as `"activity"`. The set is
  open — other values remain valid userland annotations.

## DELTA-Nwt-001.P3 Out of root-spec scope (judgment calls)

- **DELTA-Nwt-001.J1 (CLI decoration passthrough — spool, not cli.md):** The
  load-bearing `--attr key=value` decoration flag on `strand note` and
  `strand agent note` (repeatable, same convention as `add`/`update`; keys are
  ordinary strand attrs on the note strand; `--by`/`--round` unchanged) is **not**
  a cli.md (SPEC-002) contract change and gets **no `cli.delta.md`**. Per
  SPEC-002.P1 and SPEC-002.C40 the dispatcher ships verbatim argv (SPEC-002.C30)
  and per-command behavior is spool-op contract: `note` is a
  `skein.spools.batteries` op (`spools/batteries.md`) and `agent note` is the
  repo-local agent-run spool (SPEC-005.C4). The flag accretes on those spool
  arg-specs and is recorded in their spool docs at implementation.

- **DELTA-Nwt-001.J2 (kanban task tier — spool, not strand-model):** The
  epic > feature > task tier is a kanban spool contract (`spools/kanban.md`,
  SPEC-005.C4), not a strand-model change. Tasks are ordinary strands under a
  feature card via `parent-of`, with attrs declared in the vocab registry, and
  task status is DERIVED (never stored) from pure core graph + core attrs only —
  `done` ⟸ `state=closed`; `blocked` ⟸ active with a `depends-on` target not
  closed; `doing` ⟸ active, deps met, `owner` attr present; `ready` ⟸ active,
  deps met, no owner — reading no delegation or agent-run vocabulary. This rests
  entirely on existing strand-model primitives (SPEC-001.P2's "no core status",
  P5 `parent-of`/`depends-on`, P7 readiness) and adds no core contract. The
  authoring surface (`kanban task add`/`list` stamping declared attrs plus
  `parent-of`, with bare `strand add` still valid), the card/board projection of
  derived task statuses, and the `:implementation`/`:review` stage-key set are
  kanban-spool and glue concerns recorded there at implementation.
