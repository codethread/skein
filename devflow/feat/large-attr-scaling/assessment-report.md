# Large-attribute Scaling — Assessment Report

**Document ID:** `ASSESS-LargeAttrScaling-001` **Feature:** `large-attr-scaling` **Plan:** [large-attr-scaling.plan.md](./large-attr-scaling.plan.md) (`PLAN-LargeAttrScaling-001`) **Proposal:** [proposal.md](./proposal.md) (`PROP-LargeAttrScaling-001`) **Status:** `S2` numbers recorded; `S3` (residual-options assessment + verdict) and the re-run usage note are appended by later slices.

## Baseline run

- **Pinned `main` sha:** `2509e0c093d6152641c3db6ecc724f01a3b7dcbe` — the commit `large-attr-scaling` branched from. No `src/skein/core/db.clj` or `spools/text-search` change lands on `main` between that sha and the current tip (`53c19d8`), so this is the exact storage code the run measured.
- **Harness commit:** `6477bd2` (`test(large-attr-scaling): durable large-attr load harness + structural smoke`, `test/skein/large_attr_benchmark.clj`).
- **Run date:** 2026-07-11, started `2026-07-11T21:09:41.789037Z`, wall clock ~6m40s end-to-end (fixture generation + both measurement families).
- **Raw result:** [`results/results.edn`](./results/results.edn), written by the harness's own `-main` under `--out`.
- **Invocation used:** the `:test` alias in `deps.edn` pins `:main-opts` to `["-m" "skein.test-runner"]`; `clojure -M` concatenates alias `:main-opts` with any CLI-supplied `-m`/args rather than letting the CLI `-m` replace it, so the documented one-liner `clojure -M:test -m skein.large-attr-benchmark ...` (from the task body and the harness's own usage string) resolves to `skein.test-runner`, which then rejects the trailing `-m skein.large-attr-benchmark --out ...` as unrecognized arguments. Ran with an equivalent classpath instead — same paths/deps/jvm-opts the `:test` alias provides, computed via `clojure -A:test -Spath` — invoking `skein.large-attr-benchmark/-main` directly:

  ```sh
  ws=$(mktemp -d)
  cp=$(cd /Users/ct/dev/projects/skein-src__large-attr-scaling && PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk/bin:$PATH" clojure -A:test -Spath)
  PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk/bin:$PATH" \
    flock -w 3600 /tmp/skein-bench.lock \
    env SKEIN_LARGE_ATTR_BENCH_FULL=1 clojure -Scp "$cp" -J--enable-native-access=ALL-UNNAMED -M -m skein.large-attr-benchmark --out "${ws:?}"
  ```

  Flagged to the coordinator (feature card `kbcjt`, note `p1n9e`) as a harness/doc issue; not patched here (`NG2`/`OS3`).

## Seed profile (`A6`)

The full-scale default profile from `default-options` in the harness, unmodified (`--seed`/`--n` left at defaults, which already match `A6`):

| Knob | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `seed` | `1337` |
| `n` (strand count) | `250000` |
| `iterations` (timed reps per workload) | `5` |
| `measure-timeout-secs` | `60` |
| `list-size` | `500` |
| `patch-size` | `200` |
| `payload-every` | `50` |
| `payload-bytes` | `65536` (64 KiB) |
| `huge-payload-bytes` | `262144` (256 KiB) |
| `near-floor-bytes` / `near-floor-every` | `1100` / `40` |
| `mb-payload-bytes` / `mb-payload-count` | `1048576` (1 MiB) / `20` |
| `archived-fraction` | `0.2` |
| `corpus-hot-count` / `corpus-archived-count` | `100` / `40` |
| `corpus-needle` | `ZZQNEEDLEQZZ` |
| `point-read-sample` | `500` |

Measured row counts: `250000` strands, `50012` archived (≈20%), `16666` rows matching the filtered-scan predicate in both schemas, `62500` rows in the `ready` view in both schemas.

## Gate reproduction (`BG1`–`BG4`)

All five informational gate-reproduction checks the harness computes came back `true`:

```clojure
{:write-amp-payload-ge-16kb true
 :write-amp-payload-independence true
 :filtered-scan true
 :ready true
 :list-assembly-500 true}
```

- **`BG1` write-amp** (target `≥5×` reduction on `≥16 KiB` payload patches, document-patch-bytes ÷ EAV-patch-bytes, median of 200 patched rows):
  - 64 KiB payload bucket: `78280` → `32960` bytes, **`2.375×`**.
  - 256 KiB payload bucket: `276040` → `32960` bytes, **`8.375×`**.
  - Combined `≥16 KiB` bucket (the gated number): `177176` → `32960` bytes, **`5.375×`**.
  - Payload-independence check (256 KiB EAV patch bytes ÷ payload-free EAV patch bytes, target `≤1.5×`): `32960` ÷ `32960`, **`1.0×`** — EAV patch cost is flat regardless of payload size.
  - Payload-free rows: document `4120` bytes vs. EAV `32960` bytes median (accepted-slower case, per the harness's own `:accepted-small-row-cost` note — EAV patches carry a fixed page-granularity floor).
- **`BG2` filtered scan + `ready`** (250k strands):
  - Filtered scan median: document `209.84 ms` vs. EAV `180.98 ms` — EAV at or below the document envelope (target met).
  - `ready` median: document `253.12 ms` vs. EAV `426.57 ms`, ratio **`1.685×`** (target `≤1.7×`, accepted baseline `1.69×` — reproduced within measurement noise).
- **`BG3` list-of-500 assembly:** document `2.006 ms` vs. EAV `2.951 ms` median, ratio **`1.472×`** (target `≤2×`).
- **`BG4` serialization:** the run held `/tmp/skein-bench.lock` (`flock -w 3600`) for its full duration; no concurrent sibling contended the lock.

## Residual paths (`F2`)

Measured through the real shipped code (`weaver/show`, `weaver/list-lean`, `weaver/ready-lean`, `skein.spools.text-search/search`) on a disposable `:publish? false` world, `5` timed iterations each unless noted.

- **Full-fidelity point read, archived included** (`strand-row-by-id`, `500`-strand sample): median `307.23 ms`, max `1259.61 ms` (first-iteration JIT/cache outlier — remaining four samples were `293.85`–`346.41 ms`). Archived sample strand carried attribute keys `body corpus kind owner priority rank status`; the general sample carried `body corpus kind mb-payload near-floor owner priority rank status` (the full unomitted set, since this path resolves whole values regardless of size).
- **Lean list assembly** (`weaver/list-lean`, all `250000` strands): median `2075.39 ms`, max `2342.49 ms`. The `mb-payload` attribute (`1048578` bytes) is omitted from every row (`:skein/omitted true`), confirming the 1024-byte lean floor holds on the large-value regime.
- **Lean `ready` assembly** (`weaver/ready-lean`, all `250000` strands): median `2157.66 ms`, max `2356.83 ms`. Same `mb-payload` omission as the lean list.
- **Text-search `LIKE`, hot only** (default, archived excluded): median `209.23 ms`, `100` rows returned (matches `corpus-hot-count`).
- **Text-search `LIKE`, archived included** (`:archived? true`): median `408.40 ms`, `140` rows returned (`100` hot + `40` archived, matches `corpus-hot-count` + `corpus-archived-count`). **`1.952×`** the hot-only median.

## Residual-options assessment (`S3`)

This section reasons only over the `S2` numbers above (`A7`, `G3`). Options stay inside the settled EAV+archive storage and TEN-007 (`TC5`, `NG1`): the rejected side-table / transparent hot offload / artifacts-as-a-second-concept / event-sourcing / fixed-column alternatives stay rejected and are not reopened here, and no candidate mitigation may make a consumer above `skein.core.*` depend on the physical shape of attribute storage. Any change a mitigation would need is a future feature with its own proposal (`NG2`, `OS1`); this assessment recommends, it does not build.

### Large-list assembly (relates to card `ncso4`)

The lean list assembles all `250000` strands at median `2075.39 ms` and lean `ready` at median `2157.66 ms`. The `1024`-byte omission floor holds on the large-value regime: the `1 MiB` `mb-payload` value is marked `:skein/omitted true` on every row, so value materialization is not what the assembly pays for. The cost is the per-strand row aggregation: `json_group_object` over the attribute rows for each strand, scanning the whole corpus.

The lever the residual question reaches for is the `(strand_id) WHERE archived = 0` partial index `idx_attributes_strand_hot`, and it **already ships** (`A7`, `TC5`); the question is whether it suffices, not whether to add it. The measurements say it does. The gate-reproduction `ready` number came back at `426.57 ms` (`1.685×`, within noise of the accepted `1.69×` baseline), and the bounded-frontier `list`-of-500 assembly at `2.951 ms` (`1.472×`, under the `≤2×` target) — the hot-partition paths the index serves are on their recorded envelope. The `~2.1 s` lean numbers are a whole-population assembly across a quarter-million strands, not a point or frontier read; the cost scales with corpus size as a full scan should, and the bounded-frontier work this cost was left to (card `ncso4`) is done. No new index or assembly change earns a follow-up.

### Full-fidelity point read over archived rows

The `strand-row-by-id` path resolves `500` full-fidelity point reads at median `307.23 ms` (`~0.6 ms` per read; the `1259.61 ms` max is a first-iteration JIT/cache outlier, the remaining four samples `293.85`–`346.41 ms`). This path transparently includes archived rows by design and resolves whole values regardless of size — the general sample strand carried `mb-payload` unomitted, confirming the `1024`-byte floor does not reach here. That is the accepted correct-but-slower behavior: full-fidelity reads must return the full value, and TEN-003 forbids wrong, not slow. Omitting large values or excluding archived rows on this path would change its semantics, not mitigate a cost. At sub-millisecond per read the measured cost is small and bounded, so no mitigation inside EAV+archive and TEN-007 earns a follow-up.

### Text-search over archived rows (`Q4`)

`Q4` asks whether text-search seeing archived rows is a correctness concern worth a follow-up in its own right, or purely a cost question. The numbers decide it (`MI3`, `DW2`). The hot-only default scan returns `100` rows (exactly `corpus-hot-count`) at median `209.23 ms`; the archived-included scan returns `140` rows (`100` hot + `40` archived, exactly `corpus-hot-count` + `corpus-archived-count`) at median `408.40 ms`. Archived rows appear only under the explicit `:archived? true` opt-in and are excluded by default, and when requested the returned count is exactly the hot plus archived corpus. The behavior is correct and predictable: the caller gets the rows the flag asks for, no more and no fewer. `Q4` resolves as **a cost question, not a correctness concern** — the `1.952×` overhead is the cost of scanning the larger opt-in row set, it is bounded, and it is paid only when the caller asks for archived rows. No correctness follow-up is warranted.

## Verdict (`S3`)

**No action. No follow-up feature is recommended.**

The residual read-path costs the EAV design accepted but never measured are all bounded on the `S2` numbers:

- Whole-population lean assembly is `~2.1 s` over `250000` strands, a full-corpus scan cost, and the shipped `idx_attributes_strand_hot` serves the hot-partition and bounded-frontier paths on their recorded envelope (`ready` `1.685×`, `list`-of-500 `1.472×`). The bounded-frontier work (card `ncso4`) is done; the shipped index suffices.
- Full-fidelity point reads over archived rows cost `~0.6 ms` each and correctly resolve whole values, including inlined `mb-payload` — accepted correct-but-slower behavior, not a defect.
- Text-search over archived rows is correct (opt-in, default-excluded, exact row counts) and its `1.952×` cost is bounded and paid only on request; `Q4` is a cost question, not a correctness one.

None of the paths crosses into a correctness defect or an unbounded cost, so none earns a storage or read-path change inside the settled EAV+archive design. The recorded `BG1`–`BG4` baseline and these `F2` numbers stand as the durable measurement a future storage change would gate against, per `A5`.
