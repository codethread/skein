# Task 22: canonical-world cutover at user-signed weaver restart

**Document ID:** `TASK-Alr-022`
**Phase:** `PLAN-Alr-001.PH6` (canonical execution)  **Harness:** — (coordinator, interactive)
**Type:** HITL  (`hitl: true`)
**Depends on:** TASK-Alr-020, TASK-Alr-021

## TASK-Alr-022.P1 Scope

Execute the rehearsed cutover against the **canonical `.skein` world** and bring its weaver up on the
renamed code. This is **not a delegable worker task** — it is coordinator-run and gated on explicit
user sign-off, because it rewrites the live coordination world's active strands and requires a
weaver restart that tears down live shuttle/agent-run runs and the registries sibling agents depend
on. **`hitl: true`** — stop and hand to the human at the restart; never choose it for the user.

**Why HITL (say it in the body per contract):** restarting the canonical weaver is a repo hard rule
requiring explicit user sign-off (it destroys live runs and registries); the cutover mutates durable
data in the shared world irreversibly. The user must be present at the restart
(`PROP-Alr-001.C4/DW4`, `PLAN-Alr-001.PH6` gate, CLAUDE.md weaver-restart rule).

## TASK-Alr-022.P2 Must implement exactly (coordinator runbook, per Task 20's ceremony doc)

- **TASK-Alr-022.MI1:** Precondition: Task 21 acceptance is green (code landed) and Task 20's
  rehearsal passed against a SQLite **copy**. Do not proceed otherwise.
- **TASK-Alr-022.MI2:** Quiet the board (no in-flight runs mid-write), then run the Task 19 cutover
  script against the canonical world's `data/skein.sqlite`, following the Task 20 ceremony doc
  exactly.
- **TASK-Alr-022.MI3:** **HARD STOP — user sign-off:** hand to the user for the canonical weaver
  restart. The agent does not restart the canonical weaver.
- **TASK-Alr-022.MI4:** After the user-signed restart, run the `PROP-Alr-001.C5` post-restart smoke
  (`agent status` / `stalled-gates` / `kanban board` on the new keys) and confirm clean.

## TASK-Alr-022.P3 Validation / Done when

- **TASK-Alr-022.DW1:** The user has signed off and performed the weaver restart; post-restart smoke
  is clean on the renamed keys.
- **TASK-Alr-022.DW2:** The canonical world's active strands carry the new vocabulary; no
  table-mapped old key remains active.

## TASK-Alr-022.P4 Out of scope

- **TASK-Alr-022.OS1:** Authoring/editing the script or ceremony doc (Tasks 19/20).
- **TASK-Alr-022.OS2:** Any code rename (PH1–PH6) or the acceptance battery (Task 21).

## TASK-Alr-022.P5 Commit

- No commit — this is a live-world data + restart ceremony, not a code change.
