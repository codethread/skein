# Task 1: Pre-flight rebase + shard/suite reconciliation

**Document ID:** `TASK-Alr-001`
**Phase:** `PLAN-Alr-001.PH0`  **Harness:** build  **Type:** AFK
**Depends on:** none (root of the serial spine)

## TASK-Alr-001.P1 Scope

Land the feature branch on a clean base before any mutating sweep starts (`PLAN-Alr-001.PH0`,
`PLAN-Alr-001.R1`). Rebase `agent-layer-rename` over the landed tiered-test-validation queue
(`scripts/test-warm` + the per-namespace focused runner present and green) and over `vk8aa`'s
shard-tier cleanup, then reconcile any residue those landings leave in the exact files this feature
renames — the redundant `shuttle_test` sync deftest and any stale shard/suite ordering in
`test/skein/test_runner.clj`. No token rewrite happens here; this is a base-hygiene gate only. The
live card/queue ids for the PH0 blockers are in this feature's strand notes (`PLAN-Alr-001.R1`),
not restated here.

**Owned files (disjoint):** the rebase touches whatever the merge surfaces; the only *authored*
reconciliation is conflict resolution in `test/skein/shuttle_test.clj`, `test/skein/test_runner.clj`,
and any shard-ordering file the two blockers moved. Do not rename anything yet.

## TASK-Alr-001.P2 Must implement exactly

- **TASK-Alr-001.MI1:** Rebase the branch over the two blocker landings (tiered-test-validation
  queue; `vk8aa` shard-tier cleanup). Resolve conflicts by *keeping the landed base* — never
  discard a sibling's change; merge both graduations.
- **TASK-Alr-001.MI2:** Confirm the focused-gate infrastructure this feature depends on is present
  on the rebased base: `scripts/test-warm` exists and runs, and the cold per-namespace runner
  (`clojure -M:test <ns...>`) works. If either is missing, stop and report — do not proceed.
- **TASK-Alr-001.MI3:** Confirm `vk8aa` has deleted the redundant `shuttle_test` sync deftest and
  settled shard ordering in `test_runner.clj`; if a stale copy survives the rebase, remove exactly
  that residue so it cannot collide with the PH1 suite renames. Do not rename suite files here.

## TASK-Alr-001.P3 Validation / Done when

- **TASK-Alr-001.DW1:** `make build` is green on the rebased base.
- **TASK-Alr-001.DW2:** `scripts/test-warm` runs (iteration harness present); a cold focused
  `clojure -M:test <touched-ns>` runs clean. `make test-warm` is an iteration aid, never a gate.
- **TASK-Alr-001.DW3:** `git status --short` is clean (no residual conflict markers, no stray
  generated SQLite/runtime artifacts).

## TASK-Alr-001.P4 Out of scope

- **TASK-Alr-001.OS1:** Any `ns`/dir move, attribute-string swap, or doc/config/spec edit — those
  are PH1+.
- **TASK-Alr-001.OS2:** Folding in any behavior fix discovered during the rebase; card it, never
  fold (`PROP-Alr-001.NG1`).

## TASK-Alr-001.P5 Commit

- Atomic single commit (the rebase result + any reconciliation), devflow message, **no push**.

## TASK-Alr-001.P6 References

- **TASK-Alr-001.REF1:** `PLAN-Alr-001.PH0`, `PLAN-Alr-001.R1`, `PROP-Alr-001.R1`.
- **TASK-Alr-001.REF2:** blocker card ids live in this feature's strand notes.
