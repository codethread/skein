# Alpha Surface delta for agent-layer-rename

**Document ID:** `SPEC-Alr-002` **Root spec:** [alpha-surface.md](../../../specs/alpha-surface.md) (`SPEC-005`) **Feature:** [../proposal.md](../proposal.md) (`PROP-Alr-001`) **Rename table:** [../brief.md](../brief.md) **Status:** Planned **Last Updated:** 2026-07-09

## SPEC-Alr-002.P1 Summary

This is the F1 mechanical-rename delta (no behavior change). The alpha-surface index names the renamed surface in two places: the classpath-shipped reference-spool list (`reed`) and the repo-local approved-spool catalog (`spools/shuttle`/treadle/`spools/agents`). Both are token renames; while both enumerations are already being edited, they are also re-synced to the current `spools/README.md`/`.skein/spools.edn` inventory (the omitted `loom`, `text-search`, `spools/cron`, and `spools/bench` are folded in), so the edited clauses stop preserving stale source-of-truth lists. The delta also ADDS one contract statement recording the frozen trained-vocabulary surface, so the rename's deliberate exceptions are documented where the surface catalog lives (`PROP-Alr-001.G5`). Distribution tiers are unchanged — namespace family ≠ distribution tier (`PROP-Alr-001.P5.H8`): `executors/shell` stays classpath-shipped, `executors/subagent` stays approved-local-root.

## SPEC-Alr-002.P2 Contract changes

- **SPEC-Alr-002.CC1** (edit, `SPEC-005.C3`, line 13): rename the shipped reference spool `reed` → `executors/shell` (it sorts between `ephemeral` and `guild`) and fold in the two shipped-index spools the frozen enumeration omits — `loom` (sorts after `guild`) and the UNSAFE `text-search` (sorts after `selvage`). Both already ship on the classpath with their own spool docs (`spools/README.md` index), so the in-contract enumeration must list them; verified against `spools/README.md`.
  - The parenthetical is required precision, not a semantic change: after the doc move (`PROP-Alr-001.S4`) the shell executor's doc no longer sits flat under `spools/*.md`, so the descriptor would otherwise misdescribe its path. `executors/shell` stays in-contract and classpath-shipped (`PROP-Alr-001.P5.H8`).

  Old fragment:

  ```text
  …`batteries`, `bobbin`, `carder`, `ephemeral`, `guild`, `reed`, `roster`, `selvage`, and `workflow` at [`spools/*.md`](../../spools/README.md).
  ```

  New fragment:

  ```text
  …`batteries`, `bobbin`, `carder`, `ephemeral`, `executors/shell`, `guild`, `loom`, `roster`, `selvage`, `text-search`, and `workflow` at [`spools/*.md`](../../spools/README.md) (the shell executor's contract doc nests one level deeper, at `spools/executors/shell.md`).
  ```

- **SPEC-Alr-002.CC2** (edit, `SPEC-005.C4`, line 14): rename the repo-local approved-spool roots and the treadle mention, and sync the enumeration to the full approved local-root catalog. `spools/shuttle` → `spools/agent-run`; `treadle` → `the subagent executor` (its source relocates to `spools/agent-run/src/skein/spools/executors/subagent.clj`, so the agent-run root still hosts it, `PROP-Alr-001.P5.H8`); `spools/agents` → `spools/delegation`. `chime`/`kanban`/devflow untouched. The `spools/cron` and `spools/bench` roots are already approved local-root spools (`spools/README.md`, `.skein/spools.edn`) that the frozen enumeration omitted, so they are folded in here; verified against `spools/README.md` and `.skein/spools.edn`.

  Old:

  ```text
  Repo-local approved spools in this repository (the `spools/shuttle` root — which also hosts treadle — plus `spools/agents`, `spools/chime`, and `spools/kanban`) and externally distributed spools (devflow) are userland, not shipped alpha surface. Their READMEs/docs are their own contracts with their own cadence, outside this line.
  ```

  New:

  ```text
  Repo-local approved spools in this repository (the `spools/agent-run` root — which also hosts the subagent executor — plus `spools/delegation`, `spools/chime`, `spools/kanban`, `spools/cron`, and `spools/bench`) and externally distributed spools (devflow) are userland, not shipped alpha surface. Their READMEs/docs are their own contracts with their own cadence, outside this line.
  ```

- **SPEC-Alr-002.CC3** (ADD, `SPEC-005.P?` — new contract item appended to the userland/approved-spool section that contains `SPEC-005.C4`): record the frozen trained-vocabulary surface as a new contract statement. This is `PROP-Alr-001.G5` and the brief's "frozen surfaces" rows. Verbatim text to add:

  > The trained-vocabulary agent surface is frozen and does not follow the concept-naming rename: the `strand agent …` CLI verbs, the `agent-plan` weave pattern, the `agent-failures` named query, and the `:subagent` workflow-gate waiter value keep their current names. These are names agents and downstream configs are trained on, or whose blast radius is deliberately bounded (the `:subagent` waiter is pinned by `skein.spools.devflow`), so they stay put even as the spool namespaces and durable attribute keys beneath them move to concept-named vocabularies.

  Rationale for placement: `SPEC-005` is the in-contract/internal surface index and already enumerates the approved userland spools (`SPEC-005.C4`), so the "these names are pinned across the rename" guarantee belongs beside that catalog. Assign the next free `SPEC-005.Cn` number at edit time.

## SPEC-Alr-002.P3 Flagged (out of scope for F1)

- **SPEC-Alr-002.F1:** None. All three items are token renames or an additive statement of an already-decided freeze; no alpha-surface behavior or tier boundary changes. The tier assignments (`executors/shell` classpath, `executors/subagent` approved-local-root) are explicitly held constant (`PROP-Alr-001.P5.H8`).
