# Core Reconcile Contract + Image-Module Activation Proposal

**Document ID:** `PROP-Cri-001`
**Last Updated:** 2026-07-23
**Related RFCs:** None
**Related ADRs:** [ADR-003](../../adrs/0003-spool-activation-lifecycle.md) (P4 decision B, P6 decision D)
**Related root specs:** [SPEC-003 repl-api](../../specs/repl-api.md) (P5, P6), [SPEC-004 daemon-runtime](../../specs/daemon-runtime.md) (C45, C46, C94)

## PROP-Cri-001.P1 Problem

ADR-003 settled two core decisions that the install! retirement needs shipped in
skein-src before any fixture conversion can start:

1. **Decision D (reconcile contract).** Every module `:reconcile` fn receives a
   context whose `:module/contribution` carries `:status` `:applied` or
   `:removed`, but no spec text or docstring states what a reconciler must do
   with it. Two of three first-party patterns got it wrong (batteries
   re-registers unconditionally and degrades removal; chime had no registration
   at all until `2af05d7`) — the gap that hid a live production outage.

2. **Decision B (image activation, adopted).** Converting ~76 fixture
   activations from `install!` to `module!` costs ~+2.4s per suite run because
   activation reloads classpath source that is already loaded in the JVM image.
   The declaration grammar needs `{:load :image}` so a declaration can trust the
   live image, with the loud failure modes ADR-003.P4 fixes.

## PROP-Cri-001.P2 Goals

- **PROP-Cri-001.G1:** The reconcile applied/removed contract is normative spec
  text plus `module!` docstring prose, and a coordinator-level test proves a
  removal-path reconcile receives `:status :removed` (and an applied-path
  reconcile `:applied`; an unchanged contribution skips reconcile).
- **PROP-Cri-001.G2:** `{:load :image}` is a validated key of the closed module
  declaration grammar: `:ns`-target only, requires explicit `:contribute`,
  refused loudly otherwise with the module key, offending value, and allowed
  alternatives in the error.
- **PROP-Cri-001.G3:** An image-mode activation performs no source load during
  collection, and a declared-but-unloaded namespace is refused loudly at
  evaluation.
- **PROP-Cri-001.G4:** `plan`/`status` output states an image module as
  image-owned with no source stamp (`:source/status :image`, no
  `:source/stamp`), keeping the declaration printable data.
- **PROP-Cri-001.G5:** The grammar change lands as root-spec deltas (SPEC-003
  P5/P6 prose; SPEC-004 C45/C46 territory), merged on land.

## PROP-Cri-001.P3 Non-goals

- **PROP-Cri-001.NG1:** Converting in-tree spools or test fixtures — feature
  rrvnn consumes the grammar this feature ships.
- **PROP-Cri-001.NG2:** JVM-wide source-stamp fast path — rejected in
  ADR-003.P4; do not attempt.
- **PROP-Cri-001.NG3:** Kernel-level reconcile enforcement callbacks — CC13
  forbids generic resource/effect callbacks in the publication kernel. The
  existing behavior (a throw during reconcile degrades the module to
  `:degraded`) is already the loud channel for a reconciler that re-registers
  into a duplicate check on removal; this feature documents it and proves the
  status delivery, nothing more.
- **PROP-Cri-001.NG4:** New lint-conventions rules for reconciler source shape —
  a source-text heuristic for "branches on status" is fragile and dishonest
  next to the runtime channel in NG3.

## PROP-Cri-001.P4 Proposed scope

- **PROP-Cri-001.S1 (grammar):** `module-graph/declaration-keys` gains `:load`.
  `normalize-declaration` validates it closed: the only accepted value is
  `:image` (anything else is refused naming the allowed set); `:load :image`
  with a `:file` target is refused (image mode accepts only `:ns`); `:load
  :image` without `:contribute` is refused (no source evaluation happens, so no
  authoring-form collection can exist). Every refusal is an `ex-info` carrying
  `:module/key`, the offending value, and the allowed alternatives (TEN-003,
  ADR-003.P4). These throw out of `module!` on the declare path, exactly like
  today's grammar refusals.
- **PROP-Cri-001.S2 (evaluation):** `evaluate-module` takes an image branch:
  when the declaration carries `:load :image`, it performs no source load and
  no contribution-collection scope at all; it requires `(find-ns ns)` and
  reports an unloaded namespace as that module's `:failed` outcome with error
  data naming the module key, the namespace, and the remedy (load/require the
  namespace before activation) — the established per-module failure channel,
  which `:required? true` escalates per SPEC-004.C94. The contribution comes
  from the declared `:contribute` fn as today. The outcome carries
  `:source/status :image` and no `:source/stamp`. Non-image declarations are
  byte-for-byte untouched.
- **PROP-Cri-001.S3 (honesty):** `plan` and `status` need no new plumbing: the
  per-module outcome (`:source/status :image`, absent stamp) and the
  introspectable declaration (`:load :image` in the graph) are the honest
  signals, mirroring CC14's caveat style. Verified by test, not assumed.
- **PROP-Cri-001.S4 (reconcile contract text):** SPEC-004 gains a clause beside
  C46 stating the contract: the coordinator invokes `:reconcile` only for
  `:applied` and `:removed` contribution statuses and skips unchanged
  contributions; a reconciler branches — applied ensures live resources and
  registrations, removed tears them down; running registration effects on
  `:removed` is a defect; a status outside the set (reachable only by direct
  call) fails loudly naming the received status, the allowed set, and the
  module. A reconcile throw degrades that module's outcome to `:degraded`
  (existing `reconcile-one` behavior, now contractual). The
  `skein.api.runtime.alpha/module!` docstring carries the same contract in one
  sentence.
- **PROP-Cri-001.S5 (spec deltas):** SPEC-003 P5's `module!` helper prose and P6
  example gain `:load :image`; the `::module-declaration` result spec accepts
  the optional normalized `:load` key. Deltas authored under
  `devflow/feat/fbr4m-core-reconcile-image/specs/` and merged into the root
  specs in this branch (repo discipline: root specs updated with the behavior
  change).
- **PROP-Cri-001.S6 (tests):** In `skein.weaver-test` (coordinator tier) and
  `skein.api.runtime.alpha-test` (API tier): grammar refusals (bad `:load`
  value, `:file` + `:load :image`, missing `:contribute`) with actionable
  ex-data; image activation on a bare runtime publishes the contribution
  without any source load (asserted via the namespace-load ledger /
  `:collection/reload?` evidence, not wall clock); unloaded namespace refusal;
  `plan`/`status` show `:source/status :image` and no stamp; `refresh!
  {:only}` re-evaluates an image module without loading source; reconcile
  contract delivery (removal-path ctx `:status :removed`, applied-path
  `:applied`, unchanged skips).

## PROP-Cri-001.P5 Open questions

- **PROP-Cri-001.Q1:** None — ADR-003 settled the design; this proposal only
  fixes the mechanical landing sites.
