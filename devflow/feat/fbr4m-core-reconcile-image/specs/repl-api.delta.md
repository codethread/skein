# REPL API delta for core reconcile contract + image activation

**Document ID:** `DELTA-Cri-002`
**Root spec:** [repl-api.md](../../../specs/repl-api.md)
**Feature:** [../proposal.md](../proposal.md)
**Status:** Merged
**Last Updated:** 2026-07-23
**Configuration identification:** Document IDs must be ordered as document type, short name, sequential id, then optional version. Prefix every nested point ID with the full document ID, for example `DELTA-Cri-002.P1`, so references are globally grepable and do not clash across documents.

## DELTA-Cri-002.P1 Summary

SPEC-003 P5 describes the `module!` helper's closed declaration options. It
gains the `{:load :image}` grammar ADR-003.P4 adopted, and the helper prose
gains the one-sentence reconcile contract ADR-003.P6 formalized (normative
text in SPEC-004.C46b via DELTA-Cri-001.CC1). The P6 example stays untouched:
it shows a production `:spools`-guarded declaration, and image mode is the
bare-runtime/test variant of the exported-base-declaration pattern
(ADR-003.P7) — adding `:load :image` there would misdescribe production
activation.

## DELTA-Cri-002.P2 Contract changes

- **DELTA-Cri-002.CC1 (P5 helper prose):** The `module!` helper line gains the
  optional `:load :image` mode: with an `:ns` target and an explicit
  `:contribute`, the declaration trusts the already-loaded JVM image and
  performs no source load during collection; an unloaded namespace is that
  module's failed outcome. The reconcile sentence states the contract: a
  `:reconcile` fn receives the contribution status and branches — `:applied`
  ensures registrations and resources, `:removed` tears them down; other
  statuses (direct calls only) fail loudly.
- **DELTA-Cri-002.CC2 (module `:ns` target paragraph):** The paragraph stating
  "Module `:ns` targets are ledger-loaded from the complete synchronized root
  closure" gains the image-mode exception: a `:load :image` module's namespace
  is trusted from the live image and never source-loaded by refresh. The P6
  example is deliberately unchanged (see P1).

## DELTA-Cri-002.P3 Design decisions

- **DELTA-Cri-002.D1:** The `::module-declaration` result spec in
  `skein.api.runtime.alpha` accepts the optional normalized `:load` key (value
  `:image`); the grammar's authority stays `module!`'s docstring and the
  coordinator's `normalize-declaration`, per the existing comment contract.

## DELTA-Cri-002.P4 Open questions

- **DELTA-Cri-002.Q1:** None.
