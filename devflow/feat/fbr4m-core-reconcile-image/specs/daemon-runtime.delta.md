# Daemon runtime delta for core reconcile contract + image activation

**Document ID:** `DELTA-Cri-001`
**Root spec:** [daemon-runtime.md](../../../specs/daemon-runtime.md)
**Feature:** [../proposal.md](../proposal.md)
**Status:** Merged
**Last Updated:** 2026-07-23
**Configuration identification:** Document IDs must be ordered as document type, short name, sequential id, then optional version: `DELTA-Dwr-001` for v1 and `DELTA-Dwr-001@2` for v2. Omit `@1`; append `@2`, `@3`, etc. only when a new version supersedes an externally referenced document. Prefix every nested point ID with the full document ID, for example `DELTA-Cri-001.P1`, so references are globally grepable and do not clash across documents.

## DELTA-Cri-001.P1 Summary

ADR-003 settled two core decisions this delta makes contractual. Decision D: the
module reconcile applied/removed branching contract becomes normative SPEC-004
text beside C46. Decision B: the module declaration grammar gains `{:load
:image}`, so a declaration can trust the already-loaded JVM image instead of
reloading classpath source on every activation; SPEC-004.C45/C46's declaration
language admits the new key.

## DELTA-Cri-001.P2 Contract changes

- **DELTA-Cri-001.CC1 (new clause SPEC-004.C46b — reconcile contract):** The
  coordinator invokes a module's `:reconcile` fn only for `:applied` and
  `:removed` contribution statuses; an unchanged contribution skips reconcile
  entirely. A reconcile fn branches on the status it receives: on `:applied` it
  ensures its live resources and registrations exist; on `:removed` it tears
  them down. Running registration effects on a `:removed` contribution is a
  defect by definition. A status outside the set — reachable only when the fn
  is called directly, outside the coordinator — fails loudly naming the
  received status, the allowed set, the module, and the reconciler it happened
  in. A throw during reconcile
  degrades that module's outcome to `:degraded` with the error recorded; this
  is the loud channel that catches an unconditional-effects reconciler when
  its re-registration trips a domain duplicate check on removal.
- **DELTA-Cri-001.CC2 (SPEC-004.C45/C46 grammar admission):** The module
  declaration grammar's closed option set gains `:load`, whose only accepted
  value is `:image`. `:load :image` is valid only with an `:ns` source target
  and requires an explicit `:contribute` symbol; violations are refused at
  declaration time with the module key, the offending value, and the allowed
  alternatives. Concretely, each refusal's ex-data carries `:module/key` plus:
  a bad `:load` value carries `:load` (the offending value) and `:allowed
  #{:image}`; a `:file` target carries `:load :image`, the offending `:file`,
  and `:allowed [:ns]`; a missing `:contribute` carries `:load :image` and
  `:required :contribute`, with the message stating why (no source evaluation
  happens, so no authoring-form collection can exist). An image-mode module performs no source load during collection,
  ever: evaluation requires its namespace to be already loaded in the JVM
  image, and reports an unloaded namespace as that module's `:failed` outcome
  — the same per-module evaluation-failure channel as a missing synced source;
  never a top-level `:refused`, never a throw out of `module!` — with error
  data carrying `:module/key`, the offending `:ns` value, and `:load :image`,
  and a message stating the allowed alternative (the namespace must be loaded
  or required before an image module activates).
  Its per-module outcome states `:source/status :image` and carries no source
  stamp. Declarations without `:load` keep the existing source-loading
  behavior unchanged.

## DELTA-Cri-001.P3 Design decisions

### DELTA-Cri-001.D1 Unloaded-namespace refusal uses the per-module failure channel

- **Decision:** Grammar violations (`:load` value outside `#{:image}`, `:file`
  target, missing `:contribute`) throw out of `module!` at declaration time;
  the unloaded-namespace condition is checked at evaluation and reported as
  that module's `:failed` outcome inside the refresh result.
- **Rationale:** The condition is runtime state, not declaration shape — a pure
  `normalize-declaration` cannot see the image. Per-module evaluation problems
  (missing synced source, contribution throw) already report through
  per-module `:failed` outcomes; a special throwing channel for this one
  condition would split the failure model. `:required?` semantics are
  unchanged: its escalation covers prerequisite problems per the module-refresh
  C94 clause ("Module refresh ignores advisory manifest needs/provides…" —
  daemon-runtime.md carries a second, unrelated clause also numbered C94), not
  evaluation failures. The error data carries everything ADR-003.P4's message
  discipline demands.
- **Rejected:** Throwing from `module!` on an unloaded namespace — it would make
  image modules fail differently from every other evaluation failure and break
  the coordinator's isolation of per-module problems.

## DELTA-Cri-001.P4 Open questions

- **DELTA-Cri-001.Q1:** None.
