# Convention-Resolved Spool Declarations (`def spool`) Plan

**Document ID:** `PLAN-Dsp-001`
**Feature:** `uwnzl-def-spool-convention`
**Proposal:** [proposal.md](./proposal.md)
**RFC:** none
**Root specs:** [repl-api.md](../../specs/repl-api.md) (SPEC-003, `::module-opts`/C19/C19a), [daemon-runtime.md](../../specs/daemon-runtime.md) (SPEC-004, C45/C46/C46b)
**ADRs:** [ADR-002](../../adrs/0002-no-inline-module-lifecycle-macro.md) (printable-declaration invariant), [ADR-003](../../adrs/0003-spool-activation-lifecycle.md) (activation lifecycle; a successor decision records the supersession)
**Feature specs:** [specs/repl-api.delta.md](./specs/repl-api.delta.md) (`DELTA-Dsp-001`), [specs/daemon-runtime.delta.md](./specs/daemon-runtime.delta.md) (`DELTA-Dsp-002`)
**Status:** Active
**Last Updated:** 2026-07-24
**Configuration identification:** Document IDs must be ordered as document type, short name, sequential id, then optional version: `PLAN-Dsp-001` for v1 and `PLAN-Dsp-001@2` for v2. Omit `@1`; append `@2`, `@3`, etc. only when a new version supersedes an externally referenced document. Prefix every nested point ID with the full document ID, for example `PLAN-Dsp-001.P1`, so references are globally grepable and do not clash across documents.

## PLAN-Dsp-001.P1 Goal and scope

A module's activation entry points move out of its declaration and into a `(def spool …)` var the refresh coordinator resolves by convention, so a spool author states `:contribute`/`:reconcile` once in the namespace and every consumer names only a source target and world policy. This is an ergonomics and ownership shift, not a runtime behaviour change: the whole point (PROP-Dsp-001.R4, delegated-authority ruling in kanban note `wnxuv`) is that contribute/reconcile characteristics, reload semantics, staging, dependency ordering, status branching, and removal teardown are identical before and after. The proposal (`PROP-Dsp-001`) and both feature deltas passed cold-read and TerraMed review; this plan is the strategy bridge between them and the live task graph tracked on strand `w6z1g`.

## PLAN-Dsp-001.P2 Approach

- **PLAN-Dsp-001.A1 (convention resolution, one seam):** The coordinator resolves each module's entry points from the public `spool` var in its loaded namespace at **every** module evaluation, so the `:unchanged` fast path, targeted refreshes, classpath bindings, and `reload-code!` all resolve identically (`DELTA-Dsp-002.CC1`). Only the *source* of the `:contribute`/`:reconcile` pair changes; everything else in refresh, publication, and reconcile stays put.
- **PLAN-Dsp-001.A2 (single validation source):** `s/def ::spool` lives in `skein.api.spool.alpha` and the runtime's loud enforcement validates over that same spec, so the author-facing surface and the enforcement path cannot drift (`DELTA-Dsp-001.CC2`, `DELTA-Dsp-002.CC5`). Entry points are symbols, not fn values (ADR-002.O1); unqualified symbols are coordinator-qualified so the published declaration stays printable data.
- **PLAN-Dsp-001.A3 (transitional per-key precedence):** Phase A keeps the legacy `:contribute`/`:reconcile` grammar keys and lets an explicitly declared key win per key over the `spool` var, silently and documented as transitional (`DELTA-Dsp-002.CC2`). This is precedence, not conflict, because the pinned sibling suites still declare explicit keys for in-tree namespaces during the window and a hard conflict would fail the gate the moment those namespaces gain `spool` vars.
- **PLAN-Dsp-001.A4 (retained resolved state):** Because declarations stop carrying `:reconcile`, removal-by-omission would lose its reconciler. The coordinator retains each module's last-good resolved entry-point set in runtime state and reconciles the `:removed` teardown through it, and exposes the resolved set additively alongside the authored graph in `status`/`plan`/refresh (`DELTA-Dsp-002.CC4`, G2a). This is the load-bearing new seam.
- **PLAN-Dsp-001.A5 (atomic landing, three phases):** In-tree conversion ships in the same branch as the resolution change (Phase A must be atomic), siblings convert and release next (Phase B), and grammar-key removal plus pin cutover come last (Phase C). Landing order is fixed by two constraints: `.skein/init.clj` must stay valid against pinned sibling releases at every land, and `make spool-suite-gate` runs pinned sibling suites that still carry explicit keys for in-tree namespaces until Phase B.

| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| PLAN-Dsp-001.AA1  | `src/skein/core/weaver` (`module_refresh.clj`, `module_graph.clj`)   | Convention resolution, image-mode `spool` lookup, retained last-good state, enumerated loud failures |
| PLAN-Dsp-001.AA2  | `skein.api.runtime.alpha`, `skein.api.spool.alpha`                   | `::module-opts` keys optional in Phase A; new `::spool` spec; docstring reservation of the public `spool` name |
| PLAN-Dsp-001.AA3  | `scripts/quality` + conventions ratchet                              | Repository lint rejecting malformed/incidental public `spool` vars in module-loadable namespaces |
| PLAN-Dsp-001.AA4  | In-tree `spools/*`, `.skein/*.clj`, `.skein/init.clj`                | `def module` → `def spool` (drop `:ns`), file-module `spool` vars, in-tree init triples dropped, parity test narrowed |
| PLAN-Dsp-001.AA5  | Test helpers and fixtures (`test_support.clj`, coordinator tests)    | `activate-spool!` takes and requires a namespace symbol; regression matrix for the new seams |
| PLAN-Dsp-001.AA6  | Root specs, ADR-003 successor, `docs/spools/*`, generated API docs   | Truthful per-phase contract updates, recorded C19 exception, docs of the transitional window |
| PLAN-Dsp-001.AA7  | Sibling repos (devflow, kanban, agent-harness) — Phase B             | `spool` exports, `module` deletions, own-surface conversion, `:skein/min "v1"` floors, new markers after external stamp card `b3v1r` |

## PLAN-Dsp-001.P4 Contract and migration impact

- **PLAN-Dsp-001.CM1 (grammar break, recorded not shimmed):** Phase C removes `:contribute`/`:reconcile` from `::module-opts` under TEN-000@1 — no aliases, no shims. Withdrawing accepted input keys breaks SPEC-003.C19's accretion promise for `skein.api.runtime.alpha`, so `DELTA-Dsp-001.CC5` stages the exact C19 exception wording now and promotes it into the root spec only when Phase C lands. The coordinator approved that wording under the user's delegated sign-off authority in note `dp90p`; Phase A does not break C19 because the keys are still accepted.
- **PLAN-Dsp-001.CM2 (per-phase spec truthfulness):** Each phase's land updates the root specs to describe that phase's actual behaviour. Phase A's deltas document the convention and the transitional acceptance of the old keys as a recorded pending-removal obligation; Phase C's delta completes the removal. No land ships a knowingly false root spec.
- **PLAN-Dsp-001.CM3 (no data migration, no forced restart):** No schema or persisted-config migration. The canonical world consumes siblings at pinned shas, so nothing changes there until the Phase C pin bump and refresh. Convention-dependent sibling releases set `:skein/min "v1"` only after the separate hitl card `b3v1r` stamps a Skein `v1` that includes Phase A; this feature does not own or create that stamp.

## PLAN-Dsp-001.P5 Implementation phases

### PLAN-Dsp-001.PH-A Phase A — skein-src core and in-tree (atomic, one branch)

Outcome: this checkout resolves `spool` by convention with the legacy keys still accepted at per-key precedence, in-tree spools and config are converted, and the root contracts describe Phase A truthfully. Phase A is internally split into disjoint file scopes that merge atomically into `codex/uwnzl-def-spool-convention`:

- **Core** (`5yfrq`): coordinator resolution, retained last-good state and additive status exposure, image-mode `spool` lookup, the `::spool` spec home, and the enumerated loud failures, with the tightened S1 regression matrix. Blocks runtime-dependent in-tree and records work.
- **Lint** (`c5c42`): the repository `spool`-var convention rule and ratchet tests over the existing conventions scan seam. Its structural shape came from the reviewed proposal and feature delta, so its disjoint implementation ran in parallel with core and is already coordinator-verified.
- **In-tree** (`vqwbt`): the seven `def module` → `def spool` renames, five file-module `spool` vars, in-tree `init.clj` triple drops (sibling triples retained for Phase C), `activate-spool!` signature change and fixture sweep, and truthful parity-test narrowing. Rebases onto the verified core commit so focused tests exercise the real convention.
- **Records** (`m47vr`): ADR-003 successor, truthful Phase A root-spec merges, the recorded C19 exception, `docs/spools/*` updates, and `make api-docs`. Runs after code integration.
- **Accept** (`z12za`): coordinator-only atomic verification and adversarial review across the integrated worktree before land.

### PLAN-Dsp-001.PH-B Phase B — sibling releases and floors (blocked on external Skein v1)

Outcome: after Phase A lands and hitl card `b3v1r` closes with a Skein `v1` marker that includes it, devflow.spool, kanban.spool, and agent-harness.spool each export `(def spool …)`, delete the `module` export, convert their own consuming surfaces (workspace config, fixtures, activation helpers, docs), raise `:skein/min` to `v1`, and cut new `v<int>` markers with `release-exception.md` records per each repo's precedent. Sibling suites hard-code `../skein-src` (waq0l note `5bae1`), so Phase A lands before the external stamp and sibling releases. The coordinator may prepare Phase B branches earlier but must not publish convention-dependent releases against an unmarked core.

### PLAN-Dsp-001.PH-C Phase C — pin and grammar cutover

Outcome: the transitional window closes. Bump sibling pins, drop the remaining sibling-backed triples from `.skein/init.clj`, sweep the remaining core tests and fixtures that generate explicit entry-point keys, remove `:contribute`/`:reconcile` from `::module-opts`, delete the narrowed parity test, land the Phase C spec delta with the promoted C19 exception, refresh the canonical world, and verify live — the close-out shape feature `rtnfv` used for epic `waq0l`. The epic DONE-WHEN grep gates (`git grep '(def module'` in `spools/` empty; no `:contribute`/`:reconcile` in `.skein/init.clj`) hold from here. Depends on Phase B released.

## PLAN-Dsp-001.P6 Validation strategy

- **PLAN-Dsp-001.V1 (invariance is the primary proof):** The regression matrix must show runtime semantics unchanged, not merely that resolution works. Required Phase A gates from the proposal S1: a precedence-window matrix (explicit wins per key; absent fields come from `spool`; a complete legacy declaration works with no `spool` var); a true `:load :image` path set up with only a preloaded namespace, covering both success and missing-`spool` failure with no source collection and no injected callable; and a last-good sequence where entry points resolve, a later evaluation fails, `reload-code!` runs, and the module is then removed by omission — proving the prior reconciler runs exactly once with `:removed` and that teardown, ordering, and exposed last-good status survive.
- **PLAN-Dsp-001.V2 (per-slice gates):** Each Phase A slice carries its own cold focused gate (coordinator tests for core, `make lint-conventions` for lint, focused spool suites plus `make spool-suite-gate` for in-tree, `make api-docs`/`make docs-check` for records). The pinned sibling suite gate must stay green throughout Phase A — it is what makes the precedence rule non-negotiable.
- **PLAN-Dsp-001.V3 (atomic acceptance):** Phase A queue acceptance (`z12za`) reruns each task gate in the integrated worktree, then `make build`, cold focused tests, `(cd cli && go test ./...)`, `clojure -M:smoke`, `make fmt-check lint reflect-check docs-check`, `make spool-suite-gate`, and the flock-held full Clojure suite, and confirms no generated SQLite or runtime-metadata artifacts and no unowned files. Registered change-review and complex-patch-review findings must be fixed and resubmitted before close.
- **PLAN-Dsp-001.V4 (Phase C grep gates):** The epic DONE-WHEN greps and a green canonical-world refresh with live verification gate the cutover.

## PLAN-Dsp-001.P7 Risks and open questions

- **PLAN-Dsp-001.R1 (Var-`ifn?` trap):** A Clojure Var is itself `ifn?` regardless of what it holds, so entry-point validation must deref the var and test the root value, or a malformed `spool` resolves silently (archaeology `tmzb0`, risk R1).
- **PLAN-Dsp-001.R2 (removal teardown regression):** Without the retained resolved set (A4), dropping `:reconcile` from declarations makes removal-by-omission teardown disappear silently — the exact parity-bug class ADR-003.P6 exists to prevent. The existing removal test still uses declared keys and will not catch it, so a `spool`-var removal variant is mandatory.
- **PLAN-Dsp-001.R3 (over-broad forms conflict):** The forms-vs-`:contribute` loud conflict must be scoped to `:contribute` only; a `:reconcile`-only `spool` var must still compose with collected authoring forms (the `module_adapters`/`kanban_tracker` pattern), which is valid production behaviour today.
- **PLAN-Dsp-001.R4 (status-shape breakage):** The resolved-entry-point exposure must be a new additive field, never a mutation of the authored `:modules` graph, or downstream status readers break (archaeology `niyif`, risk R7).
- **PLAN-Dsp-001.Q1 (settled — C19 exception wording):** The coordinator approved the exact SPEC-003.C19 exception in `DELTA-Dsp-001.CC5` under the user's delegated sign-off authority (note `dp90p`). It remains staged until Phase C because the legacy keys are still accepted in Phase A.

## PLAN-Dsp-001.P8 Task context

- **PLAN-Dsp-001.TC1 (detailed tracker):** `w6z1g` is the live execution plan; it owns sequencing, per-file scope, and acceptance criteria. This plan stays at strategy level and does not mirror its checklists.
- **PLAN-Dsp-001.TC2 (cold-resume IDs):**
  - Kanban card `uwnzl`, kanban task `vwa06` (its notes hold the full record: proposal review run `fgjlu`/task `6ykzo`, TerraMed reviews `8rfx9`/`74h9n`, delegated-authority ruling `wnxuv`, and the three Opus archaeology notes `tmzb0`/`xkpij`/`niyif` from read-only run `1uorm`).
  - Tracked Phase A plan `w6z1g` with children `5yfrq` (core), `c5c42` (lint), `vqwbt` (in-tree), `m47vr` (records/specs), `z12za` (accept).
  - Integration branch `codex/uwnzl-def-spool-convention`; worktrees `codex/uwnzl-phase-a-{core,lint,specs,intree}`.
  - Live tracked runs at last coordinator note `14ioi`: `hvg4g` (core), `s9xhz` (lint), `mo25j` (spec deltas). Core runs under story workflow `uwnzl-phase-a-core-story` at behavior step `u80vl` with a TerraMed reviewer.
- **PLAN-Dsp-001.TC3 (authority and boundaries):** Coordinator authority is delegated for phased implementation, tracked runs, reviews, merges, releases, rebuilds, and refreshes; skein-src `v1` must not be stamped (ruling `wnxuv`). Tests exercise the real image path, not workaround-only spellings; `:load :image` stays unless a clearly test-only spelling is materially better without widening scope.
- **PLAN-Dsp-001.TC4 (external release dependency):** Kanban task `l5lwo` (Phase B) depends on card `b3v1r`, which alone owns the Skein `v1` stamp. Until that card closes, Phase A may land but convention-dependent sibling markers and `:skein/min "v1"` floors may not.
