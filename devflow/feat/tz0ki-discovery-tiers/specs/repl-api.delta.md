# REPL API delta for discovery-tier factoring

**Document ID:** `DELTA-Dtf-003`
**Root spec:** [repl-api.md](../../../specs/repl-api.md) (SPEC-003)
**Feature:** [../proposal.md](../proposal.md)
**Related:** [RFC-Dtf-001](../../../rfcs/2026-07-20-discovery-tier-factoring.md); DELTA-Dtf-001 (cli), DELTA-Dtf-002 (daemon-runtime)
**Status:** Draft
**Last Updated:** 2026-07-20

## DELTA-Dtf-003.P1 Summary

Defines how the canonical help envelope (DELTA-Dtf-001.CC1) and its fractal node (DELTA-Dtf-001.CC2)
are **projected** from existing arg-spec (SPEC-003.C64/C65) and return-shape (SPEC-003.C60b)
declarations, fixes the authoring seam for per-node annotations as a closed validated sub-map on the
arg-spec node, clarifies that help **paths** may nest to the arg-spec's declared subcommand depth
independently of parse routing, and pins the arity of `about`/`prime`. This delta owns the projection
and authoring mechanics; the wire contract is DELTA-Dtf-001 and the runtime machinery is DELTA-Dtf-002.

## DELTA-Dtf-003.P2 Contract changes

- **DELTA-Dtf-003.CC1 (envelope/node projection):** The help envelope is built by a **level-aware
  projection**. Op-wide facts — `provenance`, `stream?`, `deadline-class`, `hook-class`,
  `raw-envelope`, and the resolved `source` — are lifted into the response envelope's `operation`
  and `source` (DELTA-Dtf-001.CC1), **not** onto the recursive node. The node is normalized from the
  arg-spec `explain` rendering (SPEC-003.C64/C65) and the per-case return-shape `explain`
  (SPEC-003.C60b) into the uniform shape (DELTA-Dtf-001.CC2): a flat op yields a root node with empty
  `children` and `invocation.mode "declared"` carrying its flags/positionals; a subcommand op yields a
  root node with empty `invocation` flags/positionals and one child node per declared subcommand, each
  the **same shape** with its own flags/positionals and routed return case; a raw-envelope op yields a
  root node with `invocation.mode "raw-envelope"`. "No per-level branches" constrains the reference
  **renderer** (one recursive function over the uniform node), not this projection.

- **DELTA-Dtf-003.CC2 (per-node annotations — closed sub-map on the arg-spec node):** `use-when`,
  `notes`, and `failure-modes` are authored as a **closed, validated annotation sub-map on each
  arg-spec node** (the op's flat arg-spec, or each subcommand's nested spec; a root-level equivalent
  carries annotations for raw-envelope ops that declare no arg-spec) — **not** a separate path-keyed
  registry that could drift from arg-spec names. `use-when`/`notes` are string arrays; `failure-modes`
  is an array of glossary outcome **names**. Validation splits across two seams, both at
  **registration**: the arg-spec **structural validator** (`skein.api.cli`, SPEC-003.C64/C63d)
  validates the sub-map's shape — closed keys, correct types — with no runtime dependency; the
  **unconditional glossary-ref existence** check runs at `register-op!`/`replace-op!` (SPEC-004.C63d),
  which has the runtime glossary, and every `failure-modes` name must reference an already-registered
  glossary outcome (DELTA-Dtf-002.CC5/CC7), failing loudly if absent. This existence rule imposes a
  **load-order contract**: glossary outcomes are registered (from the owning spool's `install!`, or
  trusted config) before the ops that reference them; `reload!` re-runs config in the same order
  (SPEC-004.C46), and builtin ops register their outcomes before themselves. The projection (CC1) folds each node's annotation sub-map into the node's
  `use-when`, `notes`, `failure-modes`; these are distinct from `about` prose (DELTA-Dtf-002.CC4),
  which stays cross-verb narrative and never restates a node-derivable fact.

- **DELTA-Dtf-003.CC3 (help paths vs parse depth):** Help **paths** may nest to the arg-spec's
  **declared subcommand depth**, independently of parse routing. Today that depth is **one level**
  (SPEC-003.C64 forbids nested `:subcommands`; SPEC-003.C65 routes on the first token), so `strand
  help <op> <verb>` is the deepest live path. Deeper help paths require a C64/C65 redesign and are out
  of v1 scope. Arbitrary-depth `children[]` recursion is a schema **invariant**, proven by a synthetic
  nested-node renderer test (`skein.test.alpha`), **not** claimed as live-op validation — no live op
  nests deeper than one level (`validation.clj` rejects nested `:subcommands`). This clarifies, and
  does not relax, SPEC-003.C64/C65.

- **DELTA-Dtf-003.CC4 (`about`/`prime` are arity-1):** Only `help` nests on the verb axis (its content
  *is* the verb tree). `about` and `prime` are arity-1 op-level meta-verbs: a verb path (`strand about
  agent delegate`) fails loudly with a redirect to `help agent delegate`. The `:about`/`:prime` prose
  is op-declared metadata (DELTA-Dtf-002.CC4), not sliceable.

## DELTA-Dtf-003.P3 Design decisions

### DELTA-Dtf-003.D1 One uniform node; op-wide facts and annotations kept off the recursion

- **Decision:** The single load-bearing shape is the **uniform node** (DELTA-Dtf-001.CC2) consumed by
  one recursive renderer. Op-wide facts move to the response envelope (CC1); authored annotations live
  in a closed sub-map colocated with each arg-spec node (CC2). The projection stays level-aware, but
  every node it emits is identical in shape, so the renderer never branches on level.
- **Rationale:** Building the batteries reference transformer (DELTA-Dtf-002 / PROP-Dtf-001.S2) over
  two op families — batteries' flat and one-level-subcommand ops plus `agent`'s deep verb tree — is
  the forcing function: if rendering op vs verb needs level-specific code, the schema is wrong. Keeping
  op-wide provenance/source and annotations off the recursion is what makes the node genuinely
  uniform and prevents false per-verb provenance. Colocating annotations with the arg-spec node (vs a
  path-keyed registry) prevents drift from verb names.
- **Rejected:** A per-level node shape (op node ≠ verb node) that forces renderer branches
  (RFC-Dtf-001.O1/O10); a separate path-keyed annotation registry (drifts from arg-spec names);
  repeating op-wide `source`/provenance on every node (implies false per-verb provenance, bloats
  output).

## DELTA-Dtf-003.P4 Open questions

_None — the projection (CC1), annotation authoring seam (CC2), and depth contract (CC3) are settled;
remaining sequencing is a plan-stage concern._
