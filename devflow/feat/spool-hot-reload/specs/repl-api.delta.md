# REPL API delta for spool-hot-reload

**Document ID:** `DELTA-shr-001`
**Root spec:** [repl-api.md](../../../specs/repl-api.md)
**Feature:** [../proposal.md](../proposal.md)
**Status:** Draft
**Last Updated:** 2026-07-11

## DELTA-shr-001.P1 Summary

Adds one blessed verb — `skein.api.runtime.alpha/reload-spool!` — to the runtime spool-workspace
helper surface (SPEC-003.P5). It makes an updated copy of an already-synced-and-loaded opt-in spool's
source *live* in a running weaver: the operation neither `runtime/reload!` (which re-runs startup files
but "does not unload already-loaded Clojure namespaces or vars", the `runtime/reload!` bullet in
SPEC-003.P5) nor a bare `(require ns :reload)` (classloader-blind to per-spool synced roots) performs. This is accretion within
the `runtime.alpha` subnamespace (SPEC-003.C19); no tier membership moves, so the Alpha Surface index
(SPEC-005.C2) is unchanged (argued in the plan). Full design rationale is in PROP-shr-001; this delta
states only the durable contract additions.

## DELTA-shr-001.P2 Contract changes

- **DELTA-shr-001.CC1:** New helper in the SPEC-003.P5 list: `(runtime/reload-spool! runtime coord)`
  takes the target runtime first (SPEC-003.C18) and `coord`, a `spools.edn` coordinate **symbol** (e.g.
  `skein.spools/kanban`, `demo/lib`) — not a namespace, because a spool is many namespaces and sync
  state is keyed by coordinate. It resolves the coordinate's synced root from approved-spool sync state,
  discovers the namespace sources under that root's `deps.edn :paths` classpath dirs (the same
  consented path set `sync!`/`use!` use), and `load-file`s them under the spool classloader in
  dependency order, so the coordinate's latest synced source goes live. It returns a data-first map
  naming the coordinate, its resolved canonical root, and the namespaces it reloaded (in reload order)
  with their source files. The blessed fn is thin and delegates the mechanics to a core seam, matching
  `sync!`→`sync-approved-spools` and `reload!`→`reload-config!`.

- **DELTA-shr-001.CC2:** `reload-spool!` fails loudly (TEN-003) on every unresolvable coordinate,
  carrying a `:reason` keyword in ex-data drawn from the runtime's **existing** vocabulary — no parallel
  words: `:not-approved` (coordinate not in approved config), `:not-synced` (approved but not synced),
  `:sync-failed` (its sync did not succeed), `:missing-root` (synced but root absent on disk),
  `:unreadable-root` (root present but not a readable directory), and `:no-namespaces` (root with no
  namespace sources — a misconfigured root, surfaced rather than swallowed as an empty no-op). The
  preconditions are checked in a fixed order: approved → sync status in the success set → root re-checked
  on disk → namespace sources present. The synced-success gate reuses the same `#{:loaded
  :already-available}` set the loader already treats as "root is on the classpath", so a root
  `reload-spool!` accepts is exactly a root `use!` could have loaded. Because `reload-spool!` resolves the
  root from post-sync state, a coordinate that synced cleanly can still have had its root replaced by a
  file or its permissions stripped since; it re-checks the root on disk with the same
  `exists`/`isDirectory`/`canRead` gate `sync-approved-spool!` uses — mapping to `:missing-root` vs
  `:unreadable-root` — rather than falling through to a raw `load-file` exception carrying no `:reason`.

- **DELTA-shr-001.CC3:** `reload-spool!` reloads *code only* and leaves registry re-registration to the
  caller — it does not call `reload!`, and `reload!` does not call it. The two are complementary halves
  of a hot bump: `reload-spool!` makes namespace **code** live (the half `reload!` skips); `reload!`
  re-runs startup files so `activate!`/`install!` re-registers ops/queries/handlers (the half
  `reload-spool!` does not touch). The blessed code-bump sequence is `reload-spool! coord` then the
  caller's own re-registration (a targeted re-`use!` of the spool's activation, or a full `reload!` when
  the bump changes registrations across the config). `reload-spool!` adds no CLI op (hot-reload is a
  trusted runtime/REPL workflow) and changes no `sync!`/`reload!`/`use!` semantics — it is a new sibling.
  It does not unload namespaces a new revision removed (PROP-shr-001.NG2; a renamed namespace lingers
  until restart).

- **DELTA-shr-001.CC4:** The SPEC-003.C17 enumeration of `runtime.alpha` helpers gains spool-code
  hot-reload alongside the config/sync/use surface. The SPEC-003 reload paragraph (the `runtime/reload!`
  bullet stating "Reload does not unload already-loaded Clojure namespaces or vars") gains a sentence
  naming `reload-spool!` as the code-reload companion for synced spools, so the two verbs' division of
  labour is documented where operators read about reload.

## DELTA-shr-001.P3 Design decisions

### DELTA-shr-001.D1 Coordinate identity, mechanism-agnostic contract

- **Decision:** The contract is "given a coordinate symbol, make its latest synced source live"; the
  load-file-under-`with-spool-classloader` mechanism is never named in the signature, docstring behavior,
  or the return map's *meaning* (namespaces and files, which any loader can report).
- **Rationale:** Keeps the verb forward-compatible with a future owned-classloader redesign (separate
  card): the core seam's body can swap loaders while the blessed signature, failure vocabulary, and
  dependency-ordered result stay fixed. Same core-owns-mechanics / alpha-owns-contract split that lets
  `sync!` change its tools.deps internals without moving its contract.
- **Rejected:** A namespace-keyed verb reusing the `use!` `:ns` loader shape — a spool is many
  namespaces and its sync-state identity is the coordinate, so a namespace argument would push operators
  to enumerate a spool's namespaces by hand (PROP-shr-001.DL1). Auto-composing `reload!` inside
  `reload-spool!` — turns a one-spool code bump into a global registry teardown and makes the verb
  un-composable (PROP-shr-001.DL2/C4).

## DELTA-shr-001.P4 Open questions

- **DELTA-shr-001.Q1:** None block promotion. The two spec-plan questions the proposal deferred are
  resolved in the plan: `PROP-shr-001.Q2` (daemon-runtime.md cross-reference) resolved as *no change* —
  daemon-runtime reaffirmed, not amended; `PROP-shr-001.Q1` (test-ns split) resolved in the plan's
  validation strategy. On promotion, CC1–CC4 merge into repl-api.md (SPEC-003.P5 helper list,
  SPEC-003.C17 enumeration, and the reload paragraph) and this delta is marked Merged.
