# Task 1: Generation-aware wake retirement (PH0)

**Document ID:** `TASK-cron-on-scheduler-001`

## TASK-cron-on-scheduler-001.P1 Scope

Type: AFK

Make scheduler wake retirement retire the *delivered* generation, not the key,
so a handler that schedules its own next same-key wake keeps that replacement
after its delivery completes. This is the primitive fix `PLAN-cron-on-scheduler-001.PH0`
and the staged delta `DELTA-cron-on-scheduler-runtime-001` (`CC1`/`CC2`); every
later cron slice depends on it because `fire-wake` self-reschedules on the same
`cron/<id>` key (`PLAN-cron-on-scheduler-001.A2`). The db signature change and its
sole caller (`run-fire!`) move together in this slice so the build stays green.

## TASK-cron-on-scheduler-001.P2 Must implement exactly

- **TASK-cron-on-scheduler-001.MI1:** In `src/skein/core/db.clj`, make
  `retire-wake!` (`~1510`) generation-aware. It must retire exactly the
  delivered generation — the wake identified by its `key` **and** the delivered
  `wake_at` (epoch millis) — via `DELETE ... WHERE key = ? AND wake_at = ?`
  (mirroring the generation-specific claim in `mark-wake-attempt!`, `~1478`), and
  record its `scheduler_history` row from the *delivered row that was read before
  the handler ran*, never from a fresh `require-pending-wake`/key lookup. When the
  delivered generation no longer holds the key (superseded by a same-key
  replacement, or already vanished), retire no pending row but still insert the
  history entry from the delivered row (`DELTA-cron-on-scheduler-runtime-001.CC2`).
- **TASK-cron-on-scheduler-001.MI2:** Thread the delivered generation into
  `complete-wake!` (`~1532`) and `fail-wake!` (`~1539`): each takes the delivered
  row (or its `key` + delivered `wake_at`) and forwards it to `retire-wake!`.
  `cancel-wake!` (`~1525`) stays key-based — it cancels whichever generation
  currently holds the key and keeps its loud-on-missing-key contract
  (`DELTA-cron-on-scheduler-runtime-001.CC2`/`D2`). A user cancel of a truly
  missing key still throws; a delivery retirement of a superseded generation does
  not throw (it records history only).
- **TASK-cron-on-scheduler-001.MI3:** In `src/skein/core/weaver/scheduler.clj`,
  `run-fire!` (`~303`) already re-reads the delivered `row` (`~317`) and holds the
  delivered generation as `(:scheduler/wake-at-millis envelope)`. Pass that
  delivered row/generation into the `complete-wake!` (`~346`) and `fail-wake!`
  (`~348`, `~355`) calls so retirement targets the generation that actually fired.
- **TASK-cron-on-scheduler-001.MI4:** Add focused db-level tests to
  `test/skein/core/scheduler_test.clj` for the generation-aware retirement
  mechanic (see `DW2`).

## TASK-cron-on-scheduler-001.P3 Done when

- **TASK-cron-on-scheduler-001.DW1:** `retire-wake!`/`complete-wake!`/`fail-wake!`
  retire by `(key, delivered wake_at)` and record history from the delivered row;
  `cancel-wake!` remains key-based.
- **TASK-cron-on-scheduler-001.DW2:** New `skein.core.scheduler-test` assertions
  pass: (a) completing a delivered generation while a same-key replacement (a
  different `wake_at`) is already pending deletes **only** the delivered
  generation — the replacement pending row survives — and the delivered fire is
  recorded in completed history; (b) the failing path (`fail-wake!`) proves the
  same under a recorded error; (c) retiring a delivered generation that has
  already been superseded/removed deletes no pending row yet still records the
  delivered fire in history.
- **TASK-cron-on-scheduler-001.DW3:** Cold focused run green:
  `clojure -M:test skein.core.scheduler-test skein.scheduler-runtime-test skein.api.scheduler.alpha-test skein.scheduler-e2e-test`
  (the four scheduler suites — `PLAN-cron-on-scheduler-001.PH0` gate; the last
  three prove the signature change caused no regression).
- **TASK-cron-on-scheduler-001.DW4:** `make fmt-check lint` clean for the touched
  Clojure sources.

## TASK-cron-on-scheduler-001.P4 Out of scope

- **TASK-cron-on-scheduler-001.OS1:** No cron changes; `spools/cron` is untouched
  in this slice (that is task 2).
- **TASK-cron-on-scheduler-001.OS2:** No other reshaping of the scheduler
  primitive — only the retirement mechanic and its tests change
  (`PLAN-cron-on-scheduler-001.NG1`/`V6`).
- **TASK-cron-on-scheduler-001.OS3:** Do not promote the `SPEC-004` delta into the
  root spec here; promotion is task 7 (`PLAN-cron-on-scheduler-001.CM1`).
