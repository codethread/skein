## PLAN-ssc-001.P1 Goal and scope

Ship a blocking gate that runs the pinned external spool suites (`codethread/devflow.spool`,
`codethread/kanban.spool`) against skein-src HEAD, closing the untested skein-src→spool direction
(proposal PROP-ssc-001.P1). The gate reads the spool shas from `deps.edn` (the single source of
truth), arranges the sibling layout each spool's `:test` alias expects, adds the workflow-spool root
the `devflow.spool` run needs, and runs each spool's own `clojure -M:test`. One local-reproduction
surface owns that logic and is reused by CI, the land `merge-local-verify` gate, and manual runs
(PROP-ssc-001.G4 / TEN-004). Scope is CI/process infrastructure only: `.github/workflows/quality.yml`,
a make target, and the land workflow instruction in `.skein/workflows.clj`. No skein source, no spool
repos, no pin bumps (PROP-ssc-001.NG1–NG3). This stage is docs-only; implementation lands in the next
stage.

## PLAN-ssc-001.P2 Approach

- **PLAN-ssc-001.A1 — One local-reproduction surface (resolves PROP-ssc-001.Q1).** A single make
  target (working name `make spool-suite-gate`) owns the whole recipe: sha extraction, scratch
  sibling-layout arrangement, the devflow-only workflow-spool injection, running each spool suite,
  and failure attribution. CI and land both call this target rather than re-open-coding the layout.
  This resolves PROP-ssc-001.Q1 toward the single-source option: G4/TEN-004 explicitly prioritize one
  home for the layout logic over CI-native per-repo caching, and native caching is not meaningfully
  lost — the spool suites' *transitive* deps still resolve through `~/.gitlibs`/`~/.m2`, which the
  existing `actions/cache` steps already persist (PLAN-ssc-001.A5). The spool *source* trees are
  cheap shallow fetches at a fixed sha and gain little from caching.

- **PLAN-ssc-001.A2 — Sha extraction from `deps.edn`, never restated (PROP-ssc-001.G2/S2).** The
  target reads the two spool coordinates from `deps.edn` `:aliases :test :extra-deps`
  (`io.github.codethread/devflow.spool`, `io.github.codethread/kanban.spool`) and pulls each
  `:git/sha`. Read `deps.edn` as EDN (e.g. a `clojure -X`/babashka one-liner) rather than line-grep so
  a formatting change cannot silently desync the gate. The shas are never written into the workflow
  file or the make target; `.skein/spools.edn` keeps its own synchronized copy for the weaver, and
  that pairing is already enforced by `config_test` — this gate does not touch it.

- **PLAN-ssc-001.A3 — Sibling-layout arrangement (PROP-ssc-001.S3).** For each spool: materialize the
  spool source at its pinned sha into a scratch working dir (shallow `git clone` + `git checkout
  <sha>`, or an equivalent `~/.gitlibs` copy), and arrange a `skein-src` entry beside it resolving to
  the candidate skein-src at HEAD, matching the spools' committed `:local/root "../skein-src"` default.
  "Candidate skein-src at HEAD" means the **invoking repo checkout** — the PR head on CI, the merged
  local main at land (A6) — never a hard-coded PR-head assumption; resolve it from the make target's
  own working directory. Use a scratch root (`mktemp -d`), never the developer's real sibling tree.

- **PLAN-ssc-001.A4 — Devflow-only workflow-spool injection (PROP-ssc-001.S3; empirically forced).**
  `devflow.spool@e9b28f5`'s `:test` alias supplies only `io.skein/skein {:local/root "../skein-src"}`
  plus camel-snake-kebab; a `:local/root` consumer receives skein's `:deps :paths` but **not** its
  `:test :extra-paths`, where `spools/workflow/src` lives. `skein.spools.devflow` requires
  `skein.spools.workflow`, so the devflow suite is RED on a clean HEAD with
  `Could not locate skein/spools/workflow` until the moved root is supplied. The gate runs the devflow
  suite with the workflow-spool root injected at job time:
  `clojure -Sdeps '{:deps {io.skein/workflow-spool {:local/root "../skein-src/spools/workflow"}}}' -M:test`.
  Only NG2-safe injection forms are permitted: the `-Sdeps` command-line dep map above, or a
  skein-src-side/user `deps.edn` (a file the gate owns on the skein-src side). An alias composable into
  the spool's own `clojure -M:test` can only come from the spool's own `deps.edn` — adding it there
  edits `devflow.spool` and violates NG2, so it is **forbidden**; do not add a test alias into
  `devflow.spool`. `kanban.spool` already carries `io.skein/workflow-spool` in its own `:test` alias
  and runs plain `clojure -M:test` with no injection. This is a skein-src-side run-time arrangement, not
  a spool edit (PROP-ssc-001.NG2). Red→green verified locally — see PLAN-ssc-001.V1 and task note p4nbj.

- **PLAN-ssc-001.A5 — Blocking CI placement (PROP-ssc-001.S1).** A new job in
  `.github/workflows/quality.yml` (working name `spool-suites`), a peer of `clojure-test` /
  `cli-go-test` / `smoke-test`, on the same `pull_request` + `push` triggers, JDK-21 + setup-clojure,
  with an `actions/cache` step keyed like the sibling jobs (`~/.m2/repository`, `~/.gitlibs`,
  `~/.deps.clj` keyed on `hashFiles('deps.edn')`). It is blocking (no `continue-on-error`, unlike
  `security-report`) and its single step calls the make target. Timeout ~10 min covers two ~1–2 min
  suites plus cold dep resolution.

- **PLAN-ssc-001.A6 — Land `merge-local-verify` extension (resolves PROP-ssc-001.S6).** Add the make
  target to the local verification gate the coordinator runs in `.skein/workflows.clj`
  `:merge-local-verify` (alongside the full suite, go tests, fmt/lint/reflect/docs, smoke). Decision:
  **include it.** Cost of omission: the push-to-main run (`:push-main-ci-green`) already preserves
  correctness, but a broken HEAD would land on local main first and force a `git reset --hard
  origin/main`; running the gate pre-push keeps the "verify before push" contract whole for ~1–2 min.
  This is an edit to the step's instruction string (repo coordination config), not a new workflow op.

- **PLAN-ssc-001.A7 — Failure attribution (PROP-ssc-001.G3/S5; TEN-003).** On any red suite the target
  fails loudly naming the spool (`devflow.spool` / `kanban.spool`), its resolved sha, and the one
  command that reproduces it locally (`make spool-suite-gate`, or the exact per-spool `clojure`
  invocation including the NG2-safe `-Sdeps` injection for devflow — never an alias added into
  `devflow.spool` itself; see PLAN-ssc-001.A4). The command is emitted from the resolved values, never
  hand-copied.

## PLAN-ssc-001.P4 Contract and migration impact

- **PLAN-ssc-001.CM1 — No durable domain contract change; no spec delta (judgment recorded).** This
  feature is CI/process infrastructure. Reviewed all root specs in `devflow/specs/`
  (`alpha-surface`, `cli`, `daemon-runtime`, `repl-api`, `strand-model`): none claims ownership of the
  CI pipeline, the `.github/workflows` surface, or the land gate. The external `codethread/devflow.spool`
  and `codethread/kanban.spool` are downstream consumers of skein, not skein-shipped reference spools —
  SPEC-005.C3's in-contract reference-spool list is exactly the in-tree spools (`bobbin`, `carder`,
  `ephemeral`, `executors/shell`, `guild`, `loom`, `roster`, `selvage`, `text-search`, `workflow`) and
  does not include them, so no alpha-surface contract covers these suites. SPEC-005.C4 makes the point
  directly rather than by omission: it names `devflow` by name as externally-distributed userland
  "outside this line", owning its own README/cadence contracts — so no skein alpha-surface contract can
  cover these suites and no `*.delta.md` is warranted. The land workflow op surface
  lives in `.skein/workflows.clj`, which is repo coordination config, not a root-spec domain, and the
  `:merge-local-verify` change is an instruction-string edit, not a new op or a change to any workflow
  engine contract. `deps.edn` is read only. Therefore no `*.delta.md` is written; the durable pins stay
  in `deps.edn`/`.skein/spools.edn` unchanged. (Also recorded as a task note on this strand.)

## PLAN-ssc-001.P5 Implementation phases

### PLAN-ssc-001.PH1 Local-reproduction surface

Outcome: `make spool-suite-gate` exists and is the single home for the recipe — extracts both shas
from `deps.edn`, arranges a scratch sibling layout, injects the workflow-spool root for the devflow
run only, runs both spool suites against HEAD, and on failure names the spool, sha, and local repro
command. Provable in isolation: green against a clean HEAD, red with a legible message against a
HEAD that breaks a spool. No CI or land wiring yet.

### PLAN-ssc-001.PH2 Blocking CI job

Outcome: a blocking `spool-suites` job in `quality.yml`, a peer of the existing suite gates on PR and
push-to-main, caching like its siblings, whose single step calls the PH1 target. Provable by the job
running green on this feature's PR and red (blocking the check) on a deliberately-broken probe.

### PLAN-ssc-001.PH3 Land merge-local-verify extension

Outcome: the land `:merge-local-verify` step's local verification gate includes the PH1 target, so the
coordinator runs the spool suites before pushing main. Provable by smoke-testing the workflow config in
a disposable world and confirming the rendered step instruction lists the new gate.

## PLAN-ssc-001.P6 Validation strategy

- **PLAN-ssc-001.V1 — The gate proves itself via the empirical red→green scenarios.** Already
  reproduced locally in a `/tmp/claude` scratch sibling layout (task note p4nbj): devflow.spool@e9b28f5
  is RED (`clojure -M:test` → exit 1, `Could not locate skein/spools/workflow`) and GREEN with the
  `-Sdeps` workflow-spool injection (18 tests / 130 assertions, 0 failures); kanban.spool@54eea43 is
  GREEN plain (25 tests / 173 assertions). The implementation must re-run these against the make target:
  green target run on clean HEAD, and a red target run where HEAD deliberately breaks a spool
  (e.g. a scratch edit removing/renaming a required namespace) yielding the attributed failure message.
- **PLAN-ssc-001.V2 — No Clojure src/test namespaces change, so there is no per-slice cold-run gate.**
  The feature touches `Makefile` (shell), `quality.yml` (YAML), and `.skein/workflows.clj` (repo
  config). Per the three-tier discipline, cold focused runs `clojure -M:test <ns...>` gate only slices
  that touch Clojure namespaces — none here. The full locked suite
  (`flock -w 3600 /tmp/skein-test.lock clojure -M:test`) is unchanged by this feature and is exercised
  only at queue acceptance and at land, per policy.
- **PLAN-ssc-001.V3 — CI job validated live.** PH2 is proven by the job's own run on this feature's PR
  (green) and by a throwaway probe commit that breaks a spool (the check goes red and blocks). Existing
  quality gates (fmt/lint/reflect/docs, go, smoke, full suite) must stay green.
- **PLAN-ssc-001.V4 — Land config validated in a disposable world.** PH3 is smoke-tested against a
  `mktemp -d` `--workspace` world (never the canonical `.skein`): load the workflow config, render the
  `:merge-local-verify` step, and confirm the instruction lists the new gate. Config pickup at runtime
  is `runtime/reload!`, never a weaver restart.

## PLAN-ssc-001.P7 Risks and open questions

- **PLAN-ssc-001.R1 — Pin drift between `deps.edn` and `.skein/spools.edn`.** Mitigation: the gate
  reads only `deps.edn`; the existing `config_test` already enforces the `deps.edn`↔`spools.edn`
  pairing, so no new synchronization surface is introduced.
- **PLAN-ssc-001.R2 — Hosted-runner flakiness / timing.** The spool suites are short (~1–2 min) and do
  not use the skein await-budget harness, so `SKEIN_TEST_AWAIT_SCALE` is not relevant; a ~10 min job
  timeout absorbs cold dep resolution. Mitigation: cache `~/.gitlibs`/`~/.m2` like sibling jobs.
- **PLAN-ssc-001.R3 — Injection form fragility.** If a future devflow.spool pin changes its `:test`
  alias to carry the workflow root itself, the `-Sdeps` injection becomes redundant but harmless
  (duplicate local root). Mitigation: the injection is keyed off the current pin and re-verified by V1
  whenever the pin advances (a deliberate human change, NG1).

## PLAN-ssc-001.P8 Task context

- **PLAN-ssc-001.TC1:** Feature branch `spool-suite-ci-gate`, kanban card `yhqfh` (p2). Read
  `proposal.md` (PROP-ssc-001, approved rev 5311d59) and `brief.md` first.
- **PLAN-ssc-001.TC2:** The devflow-red / kanban-green asymmetry (PLAN-ssc-001.A4) is the crux; do not
  assume a plain sibling layout suffices for both. Task note p4nbj on this strand has the exact red and
  green commands and counts.
- **PLAN-ssc-001.TC3:** Owned files at implementation: `Makefile`, `.github/workflows/quality.yml`,
  `.skein/workflows.clj`. `deps.edn`/`.skein/spools.edn` are read-only (no pin bump — NG1). No changes
  to the spool repos (NG2) or committed cross-repo paths (NG3).
- **PLAN-ssc-001.TC4:** `.skein/workflows.clj` config changes pick up via `runtime/reload!`; smoke-test
  in a disposable `mktemp -d` `--workspace` world, never the canonical `.skein`, and never restart a
  running weaver.
- **PLAN-ssc-001.TC5 — Task-queue strategy (three AFK slices, linear PH1→PH2→PH3).** The queue mirrors
  the phases: (001) the `make spool-suite-gate` target owning sha-extraction + sibling layout + the
  NG2-safe devflow-only `-Sdeps` workflow-spool injection + failure attribution, self-validated by the
  V1 red→green plus a malformed-`deps.edn` sha-extraction-fails-loudly probe; (002) the blocking
  `spool-suites` job in `quality.yml` calling the target, syntactically validated locally with the live
  green/red proof deferred honestly to the PR CI at land; (003) the land `:merge-local-verify`
  instruction-string extension in `.skein/workflows.clj`, smoke-tested in a disposable `--workspace`
  world with `runtime/reload!`, never a weaver restart. 002 and 003 both depend on 001; they are
  independent of each other. No Clojure src/test namespace changes, so no per-slice `clojure -M:test`
  cold gate applies (V2) — the gates are the shell/YAML/config validations named in each task file.

## PLAN-ssc-001.P9 Developer Notes

### PLAN-ssc-001.DN1 Task pz2cp: spec-plan stage — 2026-07-11

- Spec-delta judgment: no durable domain contract changes; no `*.delta.md` written. Full argument in
  PLAN-ssc-001.CM1 and mirrored to this task strand as a note. Reviewed all five root specs before
  concluding.
- PROP-ssc-001.Q1 (CI checkout mechanism) resolved in PLAN-ssc-001.A1 toward the single-source make
  target. PROP-ssc-001.S6 (land gate) resolved in PLAN-ssc-001.A6 as **include**.
- S3 red→green empirically re-confirmed from task note p4nbj (predecessor u0avh); the plan does not
  re-run it — the implementer must, against the actual make target.

### PLAN-ssc-001.DN2 Task txnue: task-queue stage — 2026-07-11

- Applied the four orthogonal nice-to-haves from plan-review synthesis note `lqqg1` (run a0p9p) before
  flipping Status Draft→Reviewed:
  - NTH-1: CM1 now cites SPEC-005.C4 (names `devflow` by name as externally-distributed userland
    "outside this line"), a direct authority stronger than C3's exclusion-by-omission.
  - NTH-2: A4/A7 now name only the NG2-safe injection forms (`-Sdeps` or a skein-src-side/user
    `deps.edn`) and explicitly forbid adding a test alias into `devflow.spool`'s own `deps.edn`.
  - NTH-3: A3 now resolves "candidate skein-src" to the invoking repo checkout (PR head on CI, merged
    local main at land), avoiding a hard-coded PR-head assumption that would misbehave at land.
  - NTH-4 (provenance nit, no plan defect): the empirical reproduction note is `p4nbj` (by u0avh) on
    this feature's card, not the `in1kg` id cited in the launch brief. The plan already cites `p4nbj`
    correctly at V1/TC2/DN1; task 001 references `p4nbj`.
- Queue written: three linear AFK slices (001 make target → 002 CI job → 003 land extension). No
  cycles; 002 and 003 both blocked_by 001, independent of each other.
