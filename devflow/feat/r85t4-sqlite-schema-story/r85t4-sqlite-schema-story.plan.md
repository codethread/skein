# SQLite schema story Plan

**Document ID:** `PLAN-Sss-001`
**Feature:** `r85t4-sqlite-schema-story`
**Proposal:** [proposal.md](./proposal.md)
**RFC:** none
**Root specs:** [strand-model.md](../../specs/strand-model.md), [daemon-runtime.md](../../specs/daemon-runtime.md)
**Feature specs:** [specs/strand-model.delta.md](./specs/strand-model.delta.md), [specs/daemon-runtime.delta.md](./specs/daemon-runtime.delta.md)
**Status:** Draft
**Last Updated:** 2026-07-22
**Configuration identification:** Document IDs must be ordered as document type, short name, sequential id, then optional version:
`PLAN-Dwr-001` for v1 and `PLAN-Dwr-001@2` for v2. Omit `@1`; append `@2`, `@3`, etc. only when a new version supersedes an externally
referenced document. Prefix every nested point ID with the full document ID so references are globally grepable and do not clash across documents.

## PLAN-Sss-001.P1 Goal and scope

Implement the persistence-evolution contract decided in `PROP-Sss-001` and staged in `DELTA-Sss-001`/`DELTA-Sss-002`: stamp schema
generation 1 in `PRAGMA user_version`, gate storage initialization on the stamp in both skew directions, and adopt unstamped
current-shape databases via a canonical structural validator. Generation 1 ships no executable ladder machinery (`DELTA-Sss-002.Q1`);
the deliverable is the contract, the guard, and the stamp — kept as small as the decision allows (TEN-004).

## PLAN-Sss-001.P2 Approach

- **PLAN-Sss-001.A1:** All work lands in `skein.core.db` (per the repo persistence boundary). No API-surface, CLI, or spool changes:
  the stamp and gate sit entirely behind `init!`, which every storage entry point already funnels through. No migration namespace or
  step registry is created — the executable ladder home is deferred with `DELTA-Sss-002.Q1`, and the first generation bump owes the
  freeze of the generation-1 reference into the migration space it creates (`DELTA-Sss-002.CC3`).
- **PLAN-Sss-001.A2 (canonical validator):** Rather than hand-maintaining introspection predicates per table (today's
  `ensure-current-schema!` approach, which only rejects known-past shapes), construct a fresh reference database in memory from
  `schema-sql` (the `:sqlite-memory` seam, `SPEC-004.C93`, already runs identical schema code), introspect both databases —
  `sqlite_master` plus `PRAGMA table_info`/`index_list`/`index_info`/`foreign_key_list` — into normalized shape maps, and compare.
  Comparison covers exact columns, order, declared types, nullability, defaults, primary keys, foreign keys, CHECK constraints, index
  columns/order/uniqueness, and partial-index predicates, for Skein-owned tables and indexes, rejecting extra columns on managed tables
  (`DELTA-Sss-002.CC2`). The validator takes two comparison modes: pre-DDL screening (every baseline object present and exact; only
  additive-since-baseline objects may be absent — `DELTA-Sss-002.CC2a`; the additive set is empty at stamp introduction) and full
  (post-DDL acceptance). While `current-generation` is 1, the live `schema-sql` *is* the
  generation-1 reference; the reference-db construction makes the validator self-maintaining within a generation, and the first bump
  snapshots the outgoing reference per `DELTA-Sss-002.CC3`.
- **PLAN-Sss-001.A3 (generation gate):** Classification is a pure decision function over `(found-generation, binary-generation,
  empty?)` returning bootstrap / adopt / proceed / refuse-newer / refuse-older, unit-testable across every branch including generations
  that cannot yet occur on disk. `init!` reads `user_version` before any DDL and routes: empty unstamped db → DDL, full validation,
  stamp; non-empty unstamped → pre-DDL screening, refuse untouched on mismatch, else DDL, full validation, stamp 1; at generation →
  pre-DDL screening (a missing baseline object refuses rather than being silently recreated), then DDL (fills additive objects), full
  validation; newer/older stamped → refuse untouched with found/expected in the error data, older naming the migration path. `current-generation` is a `skein.core.db` constant beside `schema-sql`. The existing
  legacy-shape throws (`ensure-current-schema!`) fold into the validator's mismatch reporting rather than surviving as a parallel
  mechanism.

## PLAN-Sss-001.P3 Affected areas

| ID                  | Area                                | Expected change                                                              |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| PLAN-Sss-001.AA1    | `src/skein/core/db.clj`             | Generation gate + `current-generation` in `init!`; canonical validator replaces shape predicates |
| PLAN-Sss-001.AA3    | `test/skein/core/`                  | Generation/adoption/skew coverage beside existing `db_test.clj` schema tests  |
| PLAN-Sss-001.AA4    | `devflow/specs/`                    | Promote `DELTA-Sss-001`/`DELTA-Sss-002` into SPEC-001/SPEC-004 at finish      |

## PLAN-Sss-001.P4 Contract and migration impact

- **PLAN-Sss-001.CM1:** Contract changes are exactly `DELTA-Sss-001` (SPEC-001.P8 evolution classes + stamp) and `DELTA-Sss-002`
  (SPEC-004 generation-aware init, adoption, ladder, error contract). On-disk impact for existing healthy worlds is one metadata pragma
  write (`user_version` 0 → 1) at first open by a generation-aware weaver; no row data changes.

## PLAN-Sss-001.P5 Implementation phases

### PLAN-Sss-001.PH1 Canonical validator + generation gate + stamp

Outcome: `init!` enforces the full `DELTA-Sss-002.CC1/CC2/CC4` contract with the reference-db validator, bootstrap and adoption
stamping, both skew refusals with found/expected generations in the error data, and legacy-shape rejection folded in. Test coverage:
unit tests on the pure classification function across every branch (including older/newer stamped generations, simulated by
parameterizing the binary generation); integration tests for fresh empty db bootstrapped and stamped; unstamped matching db adopted
idempotently; unstamped mismatched db (missing column, extra column, wrong index, legacy document/edge-constraint shapes) refused
without a stamp write; stamped current-generation db lacking an additive auxiliary table opened and back-filled, while one lacking a
baseline object is refused untouched; unstamped non-empty db lacking an additive auxiliary object passing pre-DDL screening, gaining
the object from DDL, passing full validation, and only then being stamped; newer-generation db refused untouched; older-generation
refusal (via a hand-stamped `user_version` against a parameterized binary generation) naming the migration path.

### PLAN-Sss-001.PH2 Spec promotion and index

Outcome: deltas merged into SPEC-001/SPEC-004 (marked Merged), `devflow/README.md` index updated, `rapv5` unblocked with a citable
contract. Runs with the devflow finish stage.

## PLAN-Sss-001.P6 Validation strategy

- **PLAN-Sss-001.V1:** Per-slice gate: cold `clojure -M:test` on the touched `skein.core` test namespaces (db + new generation tests).
- **PLAN-Sss-001.V2:** Adoption safety is proven by tests that assert `user_version` remains 0 after every refused adoption and that the
  logical contents of every Skein-owned table (all `strands`/`attributes`/`strand_edges`/`acyclic_relations`/scheduler rows) are equal
  before and after a successful adoption.
- **PLAN-Sss-001.V3:** Queue acceptance: full locked suite, `clojure -M:smoke` (exercises real weaver boot on a fresh world → stamps
  gen 1), `(cd cli && go test ./...)`, and the `make fmt-check lint reflect-check docs-check` gates.
- **PLAN-Sss-001.V4:** Manual skew check in a disposable workspace: open a world, bump `user_version` by hand via `sqlite3`, confirm the
  refusal message carries found/expected generations.

## PLAN-Sss-001.P7 Risks and open questions

- **PLAN-Sss-001.R1:** SQLite introspection normalization (type affinity spellings, autoindexes, whitespace in `sqlite_master` SQL) can
  make the canonical comparison brittle. Mitigation: compare structured pragma output, not raw SQL text, except for CHECK/partial-index
  predicates where normalized SQL substrings are unavoidable; ignore `sqlite_autoindex_*` and non-Skein objects explicitly.
- **PLAN-Sss-001.R2:** Stamping at boot writes to a db the old code path treated read-only during validation. Mitigation: stamp only
  after full validation passes, in the same code path that already performs DDL writes.

## PLAN-Sss-001.P8 Task context

- **PLAN-Sss-001.TC1:** Read `PROP-Sss-001` and both deltas first; the deltas are the contract being implemented, clause by clause.
  Key code: `src/skein/core/db.clj` (`schema-sql`, `ensure-current-schema!`, `init!`, the `:sqlite-memory` constructor). Existing
  schema-rejection tests live in `test/skein/core/db_test.clj` (`init-rejects-old-document-strand-schema` etc.) and show the fixture
  style for building legacy shapes. Keep SQL in `skein.core.db`; runtimes in tests are `:publish? false`.
