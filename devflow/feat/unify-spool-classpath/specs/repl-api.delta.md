# REPL API delta for unify-spool-classpath

**Document ID:** `DELTA-usc-repl-001`
**Root spec:** [repl-api.md](../../../specs/repl-api.md) (`SPEC-003`)
**Feature:** [../proposal.md](../proposal.md) (`PROP-usc-001`)
**Contract:** [../brief.md](../brief.md)
**Status:** Draft
**Last Updated:** 2026-07-11

## DELTA-usc-repl-001.P1 Summary

`SPEC-003` documents `runtime/use!`'s `:ns` loader as falling back to ordinary `require`
when no synced source exists (root spec line 119). `PROP-usc-001.C4` removes that fallback
so `use!` `:ns` can never silently classpath-load a spool. This delta rewrites the one
loader sentence: a `:ns` target with no synced source now fails loudly, and the only
classpath-resident code (blessed `skein.api.*.alpha` namespaces and the `batteries`
exception) is loaded by an explicit top-level `require`, not through `use!`'s `:ns`
search. `SPEC-003.C63` (batteries as a classpath `skein.spools.*` reference spool) stays
true and is reaffirmed, not changed. One companion clause also updates: `SPEC-003.C63f`,
whose reference-spool layering example is `skein.spools.roster`, calls roster a *classpath*
reference spool — but `roster` is one of the spools this feature moves off the shipped
classpath (`PROP-usc-001.C3`, plan PH2). This delta reframes C63f so the layering guidance
survives with roster kept as the worked example, now an approved opt-in spool rather than a
classpath one. No other `SPEC-003` clause changes.

## DELTA-usc-repl-001.P2 Contract changes

- **DELTA-usc-repl-001.CC1 — remove the `require` fallback from the `use!` `:ns` loader.**
  In the `use!` options paragraph (`SPEC-003`, root spec line 119), delete the clause "if no
  synced source exists it falls back to ordinary `require`." The new contract: for `:ns`, the
  weaver searches synced local-root classpath entries (each root's `deps.edn :paths`,
  defaulting to `["src"]`) and `load-file`s the located source; **when no synced root holds the
  namespace it fails loudly** with the "Could not locate namespace source in synced spool roots"
  error (naming the searched roots). A guardless `use!` `:ns` for a moved spool therefore fails
  loudly instead of silently resolving off the shipped classpath (TEN-003, `PROP-usc-001.G4`).

- **DELTA-usc-repl-001.CC2 — classpath-resident code is loaded by explicit `require`, not by the
  loader.** State that code resident on the mill-resolved source classpath — blessed
  `skein.api.*.alpha` namespaces and the single `batteries` spool exception — is loaded by an
  honest top-level `require`, not through `use!`'s `:ns` search. The `use!` `:ns` loader's
  already-loaded short-circuit is unchanged: an already-loaded namespace is a no-op, so an
  explicit `(require 'skein.spools.batteries)` placed above the batteries `use!` lets that
  `use!` still record module state and run its `:call` without reaching any loader fallback
  (`PROP-usc-001.C4`). Transitive spool-to-spool requires in a spool's own `ns` form resolve
  through the `add-libs` spool classloader that `sync!` populates, never through the `:ns`
  loader, and are unaffected by this change.

- **DELTA-usc-repl-001.CC3 — reframe `SPEC-003.C63f` from a classpath to an opt-in worked
  example.** `SPEC-003.C63f` (root spec line 131) opens "Classpath reference spools may layer
  their own explicit-runtime helpers and parser-backed ops on this surface" and names
  `skein.spools.roster` as the worked example. After this feature `roster` is no longer
  classpath-shipped (`PROP-usc-001.C3` moves it to `spools/roster/src` behind a `spools.edn`
  coordinate and a `:spools`-guarded `use!`), so the "classpath" premise goes false. Rewrite
  the clause's opening to "**Approved opt-in reference spools** may layer their own
  explicit-runtime helpers and parser-backed ops on this surface" and keep `skein.spools.roster`
  as the worked example, now described as **an approved opt-in spool** (`spools.edn` coordinate →
  `runtime/sync!` → `:spools`-guarded `runtime/use!`) rather than a classpath one. The layering
  guidance — runtime-first helpers, a declared-subcommand `roster` op, a named query, and an
  async graph-integration event handler, contract at `spools/roster.md` — is unchanged; only the
  load mechanism the clause attributes to it changes.

## DELTA-usc-repl-001.P3 Design decisions

### DELTA-usc-repl-001.D1 Fail loud instead of a defensive fallback

- **Decision:** Delete the `require` fallback outright rather than narrow it to "genuinely
  classpath code."
- **Rationale:** After the feature the only classpath-resident spool is `batteries`, and an
  explicit `require` states that fact where a reader sees it — in config, not buried in the
  loader. A fallback retained "for classpath code" would preserve exactly the silent
  classpath-load hole the feature exists to close (TEN-003; `PROP-usc-001.Q4`).
- **Rejected:** Keeping the fallback guarded by a classpath allowlist; it re-creates the
  hidden-dependence surface and adds branching the explicit require makes unnecessary (TEN-004).

### DELTA-usc-repl-001.D2 `SPEC-003.C63` is reaffirmed, not changed

- **Decision:** Leave `SPEC-003.C63` (the `skein.spools.batteries` reference spool registers the
  public strand command surface as parser-backed ops; classpath, `skein.spools.*` tier) as-is.
- **Rationale:** `batteries` remains a classpath-resident `skein.spools.*` reference spool; the
  design keeps it on the source classpath as the documented exception (`PROP-usc-001.C2`). What
  changes is only *how the loader treats a missing `:ns` source*, which is the CC1/CC2 text, not
  the batteries op-registration contract C63 describes.

### DELTA-usc-repl-001.D3 Reframe `SPEC-003.C63f`, do not delete its guidance

- **Decision:** Keep `SPEC-003.C63f`'s layering guidance and its `roster` worked example, changing
  only the load framing (classpath → approved opt-in), rather than deleting the clause or dropping
  the example.
- **Rationale:** The guidance — that a reference spool may layer runtime-first helpers and
  parser-backed ops on the batteries surface — is orthogonal to *how* the spool loads and is still
  true after the unification; `roster` remains its cleanest worked example. Deleting the clause or
  its example would lose real contract guidance to work around a single stale word ("classpath").
- **Rejected:** Deleting C63f, or swapping `roster` for `batteries` — the batteries exception is
  the base surface, not a *layering* example, so it would not illustrate the same point.

## DELTA-usc-repl-001.P4 Open questions

- **DELTA-usc-repl-001.Q1:** None. The removed behavior is a single documented sentence; the
  loud-failure path it leaves is the loader's existing "Could not locate namespace source"
  error, already reachable today for a genuinely missing namespace.
