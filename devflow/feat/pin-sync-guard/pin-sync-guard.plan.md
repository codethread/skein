## PLAN-Psg-001.P1 Goal and scope

Collapse the two hand-written spool-pairing tests in
`test/skein/config_test.clj` into one data-driven guard over a declared list of
`[spools.edn key, deps.edn key]` pairs, and add a completeness assertion so a new
external spool cannot ship paired in neither file (`PROP-Psg-001.G1`–`G3`). This is
one small test-refactor slice: no production code, no config coordinates, and no
specs change. See the proposal for why the drift matters.

## PLAN-Psg-001.P2 Approach

- **PLAN-Psg-001.A1:** One `deftest` iterates a declared vector of pairs. Each pair
  is `{:spools-key <sym> :deps-key <sym>}` (e.g.
  `{:spools-key 'codethread/devflow :deps-key 'io.github.codethread/devflow.spool}`).
  For each pair the test looks up both entries, asserts both are present, then
  branches on shape exactly as the current kanban test does: both `:git/sha` →
  string equality; both `:local/root` → canonical-path equality (`io/file ".skein"
  root` vs `io/file "." root`, `.getCanonicalFile`); anything else → `throw`
  `ex-info` naming the mixed shape. Use `testing` with the pair to keep failures
  attributable. This preserves the two current tests' behaviour verbatim while
  removing the duplication (`PROP-Psg-001.G1`, `G2`).
- **PLAN-Psg-001.A2:** Keep the pairs list hand-declared, guarded for completeness —
  do not mechanically derive it from `spools.edn`. The deps.edn key
  (`io.github.codethread/devflow.spool`) is not a mechanical function of the
  spools.edn key (`codethread/devflow`): the `io.github` prefix and the `.spool`
  suffix are tools.deps conventions, not present on the weaver-side symbol. A
  derived list would have to encode that naming convention and would silently
  mis-map any spool that broke it. Instead the list stays explicit and readable, and
  a second assertion enforces that it is exhaustive.
- **PLAN-Psg-001.A3:** Completeness = set difference over the external spools
  (`PROP-Psg-001.G3`). Read `.skein/spools.edn`, take the `:spools` entries whose
  value carries `:git/url` (the marker of an externally-distributed spool; local
  spools use `:local/root` only and are carried on `:extra-paths`, not paired into
  `deps.edn`). Assert the set of those keys equals the set of `:spools-key` values in
  the declared pairs list. A new external spool added to `spools.edn` without a
  declared pair fails this assertion loudly, with the missing key(s) in the message —
  routing the author to the one enumeration site. This is the structural replacement
  for "remember to hand-write a second test," which is the exact failure the kanban
  guard suffered.

## PLAN-Psg-001.P3 Affected areas

| ID              | Area                          | Expected change                                                                                                                                        |
| --------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| PLAN-Psg-001.AA1 | `test/skein/config_test.clj`  | Replace the two `deftest`s (`devflow-spool-sha-...`, `kanban-spool-coordinate-...`, ~217–270) with one data-driven guard plus the completeness assertion. |

## PLAN-Psg-001.P4 Contract and migration impact

- **PLAN-Psg-001.CM1:** None. No shipped contract, CLI, data model, or config
  coordinate changes; the two spool coordinates and their `spools.edn`/`deps.edn`
  comments are untouched. Test-only refactor.

## PLAN-Psg-001.P5 Implementation phases

### PLAN-Psg-001.PH1 Data-driven pairing guard

Outcome: the two hand-written pairing tests are replaced by one `deftest` over a
declared pairs vector that reproduces the `:git/sha` / `:local/root` / mixed-shape
behaviour, and by a completeness assertion over the `:git/url`-carrying `spools.edn`
entries. Both current pairs (devflow, kanban) pass; a deliberately dropped pair or a
one-sided coordinate edit fails.

## PLAN-Psg-001.P6 Validation strategy

- **PLAN-Psg-001.V1:** `clojure -M:test skein.config-test` green (the cold focused
  gate for this slice's only touched namespace).
- **PLAN-Psg-001.V2:** Negative checks confirmed manually before commit: (a)
  temporarily desync one coordinate → the pairing assertion fails; (b) temporarily
  drop a pair from the declared list → the completeness assertion fails naming the
  missing key. Revert both before landing.
- **PLAN-Psg-001.V3:** `make fmt-check lint` clean for the edited test file.

## PLAN-Psg-001.P7 Risks and open questions

- **PLAN-Psg-001.R1:** The `:git/url` marker mis-classifies a spool. Mitigation: it
  is the same signal that already distinguishes the two external spools from the
  `:local/root` locals in `spools.edn`; a local spool that later gains a `:git/url`
  *should* enter the guard, which is the intended behaviour, not a false positive.

## PLAN-Psg-001.P8 Task context

- **PLAN-Psg-001.TC1:** All work is in `test/skein/config_test.clj`. The two tests to
  replace and the exact shape-branching to preserve are ~lines 217–270; the kanban
  test already carries the `:git/sha` / `:local/root` / mixed-shape `cond` to reuse.
  The declared pairs today are `codethread/devflow` ↔
  `io.github.codethread/devflow.spool` and `codethread/kanban` ↔
  `io.github.codethread/kanban.spool`; both are `:git/sha` shape at time of writing.
  Read `.skein/spools.edn :spools` and `deps.edn :aliases :test :extra-deps` for the
  live keys.
