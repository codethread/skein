# Brief: consumer cutover (rtnfv)

From kanban card rtnfv under epic waq0l (install! retirement), worked under the epic's recorded
AUTHORITY grant (epic note lpy54).

Roll the released sibling spools into every consuming workspace, verify the epic's user-visible
payoff (event-driven chime notifications live in the canonical world), and close the epic's docs
debt. Release coordinates from the sibling feature cards:

- devflow.spool v5 — peeled `98ecdd8a2fe15e4deebc83ec94596337162b46a1`
- kanban.spool v9 — peeled `46c4101befafeb2f5b3958a83c0677abc2608eda`
- agent-harness.spool v13 — peeled `35655ca2b68559e14668b78610388e94ed652efa`
- dresser.spool v1 — peeled `b05d261fdc09487109fa75143291ad6b66408b63`

The card's "staged config_ops_test edit" item is already resolved: 9snqu landed the conversion
v8/v9-compatibly (epic note dbg4e), so this feature carries only ordinary pin bumps. Smoke every
config change in a disposable workspace first; full locked suite at queue acceptance; kanban
finish the card and then the epic when every feature under it is closed done.
