# source-root-spools plan

**Document ID:** `PLAN-Srs-001`
**Status:** Draft
**Last Updated:** 2026-07-23
**Proposal:** [proposal.md](./proposal.md) (`PROP-Srs-001`)
**Brief:** [brief.md](./brief.md) (card `u4a24`)
**Spec deltas:** [daemon-runtime](./specs/daemon-runtime.delta.md) (`SPEC-004-D006`), [repl-api](./specs/repl-api.delta.md) (`SPEC-003-D006`), [cli](./specs/cli.delta.md) (`SPEC-002-D007`)

## PLAN-Srs-001.P1 Goal and scope

Ship `SPEC-004-D006`/`SPEC-003-D006`/`SPEC-002-D007`: a third approved spool
coordinate kind `{:skein/source-root "spools/<name>"}` resolved at sync time
against the running weaver's mill-resolved skein source checkout, and the
cutover of `skein.spools.batteries` from a classpath exception to an ordinary
approved spool loaded through that kind. `mill init` seeds the batteries
coordinate by default; the C50a zero-config guarantee is deliberately dropped
(TEN-000@1, no migration shim). This repo's four `../spools/*` local roots that
name shipped skein spools migrate to the new kind. Sibling-repo `.skein` sweeps
land to their own mains as coordinator follow-ups, not tasks in this plan.

Out of scope (per proposal Non-goals): `:git` and genuine workspace-local
`:local/root` semantics (`skein.macros/macros` stays), a general load-arbitrary-
paths escape hatch, and any packaging change for externally-published spools.

## PLAN-Srs-001.P2 Approach

**Core mechanism first, cutover after.** The new coordinate kind is additive: a
generation can carry `:skein/source-root` support in the sync engine while
batteries still rides `deps.edn :paths`, because the SPEC-004.C44c cutover
(C5 of the delta) is exactly "synced provider wins for module source while the
launch-classpath ownership persists until a fresh generation." That lets PH1
land and prove the kind — parse, structural validation, canonical-containment
resolution, loud failure, same-root identity, and the cutover classification —
entirely on its own, with batteries untouched. PH2 then flips batteries: remove
its source from the base classpath, add the seeded coordinate and a
`:spools`-guarded module, and migrate the repo's `../spools/*` roots, all in one
atomic slice because the gates only stay green if the classpath removal and the
coordinate/guard land together. PH3 (Go bootstrap) and PH4 (docs/spec fold) are
mechanical and file-disjoint from the Clojure/config work; PH3 in particular
touches only `cli/` and can run in parallel with PH2. PH5 is acceptance plus the
coordinator-owned sibling sweep.

**Staging reality.** The canonical weaver in the main checkout runs OLD code for
the life of this branch. No phase proves weaver behavior against that weaver.
Every runtime experiment uses a disposable `--workspace` world from `mktemp -d`
and the repo-local `./bin/strand` / `./bin/mill` built from this branch
(`make build`). The `.skein` config migration in PH2 lands with the branch but
is inert for the canonical weaver until the user restarts it on new code
(see PLAN-Srs-001.P7).

## PLAN-Srs-001.P3 Affected areas

- **Sync engine** — `src/skein/core/weaver/spool_sync.clj`: coordinate key-sets
  (~28–30), the `::coordinate` `s/or` spec (~93–99), `normalize-shared-family`
  (~193–246), `kind-shaped-root?` / `::approved-root-entry` (~562–585),
  `approved-spools` kind→root resolution (~746–753), `spool-source-fields` /
  `sync-result-base` outcome construction (~773–787), and the `non-additive-diff`
  identity comparison (~1319–1361, preserved and pinned, not weakened).
- **Locator authority** — `src/skein/core/weaver/runtime.clj`: promote the
  private `source-checkout-root` (~452–468) to a specified shared authority;
  `src/skein/core/weaver/access.clj`: a new accessor beside `canonical-root`
  (~131–139) so `spool_sync` resolves source-root coordinates the way it
  resolves `:local/root` today.
- **Refresh machinery** — `src/skein/core/weaver/module_refresh.clj`: only the
  batteries-naming docstrings/comments on the generic classpath-fallback path
  (`classpath-source-file` ~285–298, `ns-source-file` ~300–310) reword; the
  generic C50 blessed/inherited-namespace machinery stays intact.
- **Repo build/config** — `deps.edn` (`:paths` batteries removal, `:test`
  `:extra-paths` add, `:reflect-check`/`:format`/`:lint` path lists);
  `.skein/spools.edn` (seed batteries coordinate + migrate the four `../spools/*`
  roots); `.skein/init.clj` (drop the bare require, `:spools`-guard the batteries
  module); `.skein/module_adapters.clj` (docstring ~13–17 reword: batteries no
  longer "ships on the classpath").
- **Fixtures/tests** — `dev/skein/smoke.clj` (~344–428: `"{:spools {}}"`
  assertion, bare-require/module fixtures in bootstrap-clean/dirty and
  `startup-transformation-forms`); `test/skein/config_test.clj` (~1350–1351:
  batteries `:spools`-guard exemption); `test/skein/spools_test.clj` (~1983–1995:
  batteries classpath-ownership assertion); new PH1 test namespace for the kind.
- **Go bootstrap** — `cli/internal/config/bootstrap.go` (`DefaultInitCLJ` ~12–14,
  `spools.edn` seed ~43); `cli/integration_test.go` (~111–119 bootstrap
  init.clj/spools.edn assertions).
- **Specs/docs** — `devflow/specs/daemon-runtime.md` (C42/C44/C44c/C44f/C48@2/
  C49@2/C50a→C50b/C94a), `devflow/specs/repl-api.md` (C63), `devflow/specs/cli.md`
  (C14a); `spools/README.md` (classpath-exception section), `spools/batteries.md`
  (~32–47), `spools/batteries/README.md` (~7), the batteries ns/`contribute`
  docstrings + `make api-docs` regen of `spools/batteries.api.md`;
  `docs/spools/customisation.md`, `docs/spools/testing.md`,
  `docs/spools/writing-shared-spools.md`, `docs/reference.md`,
  `spools/chime/README.md`, `spools/cron/README.md`.

## PLAN-Srs-001.P4 Contract / migration impact

Breaking, one queue, no migration shim (TEN-000@1). The approved-kind set closes
at three: `:local/root`, sha-pinned `:git`, `:skein/source-root`. Consequences
the queue must land atomically:

- A `{:spools {}}` world hand-rolled without the seeded entry has no batteries
  ops. This is the deliberate C50a trade; smoke and integration assertions that
  encode `"{:spools {}}"` change to the seeded shape.
- The new kind is machine-independent text (`"spools/<name>"`) but resolves only
  beneath `<checkout>/spools` by canonical containment after symlink resolution,
  and fails loudly when the checkout is unavailable or the resource is not a
  readable file checkout (TEN-003) — so it persists no absolute source path
  (SPEC-002.C2 / C14a no-persist-source unaffected).
- Sync-diff identity stays keyed on the effective resolved root path: rewriting a
  live world's coordinate kind/text is additive when the canonical root is
  unchanged, while C44c changed-source/loaded-namespace and C44f Maven-baseline
  guards and pending-generation behavior are preserved verbatim and pinned by
  tests.
- `:skein/source-root` is forbidden inside a spool-root `deps.edn :deps`
  (C94a.1), joining `:git/url`/`:git/sha`/`:local/root`.

## PLAN-Srs-001.P5 Implementation phases

- **PLAN-Srs-001.PH1 (Clojure core — one seat, ~L):** Promote `source-checkout-
  root` and expose it through `access`; add the `:skein/source-root` kind to
  `spool_sync` (key-set, `::coordinate` branch, `normalize-shared-family`
  emission, `kind-shaped-root?`, `approved-spools` resolution beneath
  `<checkout>/spools` with canonical-containment/symlink confinement,
  `spool-source-fields` arm) and the sync outcome/diff paths; extend
  `rejected-spool-deps-keys` (spool_sync policy table) so `:skein/source-root`
  is rejected loudly inside a spool-root `deps.edn :deps` (C94a.1); reword the
  generic `module_refresh` batteries-naming docstrings. New focused test
  namespace covering: structural validation (reject absolute/`~`/`..`,
  mixed-kind family), resolution + canonical containment (symlink escaping
  `<checkout>/spools` fails), loud failure when the checkout/resource is
  unavailable, the C94a.1 deps-key rejection, a no-acquisition regression
  (source-root resolution never invokes git materialization —
  `materialize-families` stays `:git`-only), kind-neutral same-root identity in
  `non-additive-diff`, and synced-provider-wins classification over the
  intentional test-classpath overlap. PH1 does NOT assert fresh-generation
  classpath-ownership absence — the ambient test JVM cannot prove it (P7); that
  assertion is owned by the PH5 e2e smoke. Owns `spool_sync.clj`, `runtime.clj`,
  `access.clj`, `module_refresh.clj`, and its new test file only — must NOT touch
  `spools_test.clj`/`config_test.clj`/`deps.edn` (PH2 owns those). Gate: cold
  `clojure -M:test <new fully-qualified ns> skein.spools-test`.

- **PLAN-Srs-001.PH2 (batteries cutover + repo config — one atomic seat, ~M):**
  Remove `spools/batteries/src` from base `deps.edn :paths`; add it to `:test`
  `:extra-paths` (batteries_test requires it directly) and to `:reflect-check`
  `:extra-paths` (see P7 — reflect-check does not currently list batteries);
  confirm it stays on `:format`/`:lint`/`:splint` paths. Seed
  `skein.spools/batteries {:skein/source-root "spools/batteries"}` in
  `.skein/spools.edn` and migrate the four `../spools/*` entries (workflow,
  text-search, chime, cron) to `:skein/source-root` (leaving
  `skein.macros/macros {:local/root "spools/macros"}` alone). Rewrite the
  `.skein/init.clj` batteries module to a `:spools`-guarded `module!` and delete
  the bare `(require 'skein.spools.batteries)`; reword the `module_adapters.clj`
  docstring. Update `smoke.clj` fixtures and the `spools_test`/`config_test`
  batteries-specific assertions. Decision (resolving the P7 subtlety at
  planning time): the ambient-JVM classpath-ownership assertion in
  `spools_test` (~1983–1995) is KEPT but reworded as a test-tooling artifact of
  the `:test` alias extra-path (per SPEC-004-D006.C7); synced-provider and
  fresh-generation-absence behavior are asserted only from disposable worlds
  (PH5 e2e smoke), never the ambient `:test` classpath.
  This is one slice: the classpath removal and the coordinate/guard must land
  together or gates go red. Gate: cold
  `clojure -M:test skein.spools-test skein.config-test`
  + `clojure -M:smoke` against a disposable world with repo-local binaries.

- **PLAN-Srs-001.PH3 (Go bootstrap — one seat, ~S; parallelizable with PH2):**
  Rewrite `DefaultInitCLJ` to declare batteries as a `:spools`-guarded
  `contribute`/`reconcile` module (still requiring `current`/`runtime` and
  capturing `(current/runtime)`), seed generated `spools.edn` with the batteries
  coordinate instead of `{:spools {}}`, and update `cli/integration_test.go`
  bootstrap assertions to the new needles. Owns `cli/` only. Gate:
  `(cd cli && go test ./...)`.

- **PLAN-Srs-001.PH4 (specs + docs fold — one or more file-disjoint seats,
  ~M–L):** Promote the four deltas into `daemon-runtime.md`/`repl-api.md`/
  `cli.md`/`alpha-surface.md` (C50a replaced by C50b + the
  batteries-as-ordinary-spool contract, C42/C44/C48@2/C49@2/C94a/C94a.1/C63
  amendments plus the SPEC-003.C62-adjacent classpath-module prose, C14a, and
  the SPEC-005 reference-spool tier carve-out removal, SPEC-005-D001); replace the
  `spools/README.md` "Classpath exception: batteries" section with the
  shipped-spool coordinate story; rewrite `spools/batteries.md`,
  `spools/batteries/README.md`, and the batteries ns/`contribute` docstrings,
  then `make api-docs` to regen `spools/batteries.api.md`; sweep
  `docs/spools/customisation.md`, `docs/spools/testing.md`,
  `docs/spools/writing-shared-spools.md`, `docs/reference.md`,
  `spools/chime/README.md`, `spools/cron/README.md`. If PH4 splits into
  sibling seats, one seat solely owns the delta→root-spec promotion (the
  contractual part), and the seat that touches batteries docstrings also owns
  the `make api-docs` regeneration of `spools/batteries.api.md` (generated
  output follows its source). Depends on PH1–PH3 landing
  the behavior. Gate: `make docs-check` + `make api-docs` clean.

- **PLAN-Srs-001.PH5 (acceptance — coordinator-owned):** Full validation set
  (P6) plus the end-to-end fresh-repo smoke (which owns the fresh-generation
  classpath-ownership-absence and synced-provider assertions PH1/PH2 cannot
  prove from the ambient test JVM), then land via the landing workflow.
  The sibling-repo `.skein` sweeps (proposal G4/S6) are separate repos landed
  to their own mains, tracked as kanban tasks under card `u4a24`; feature
  finish (`kanban finish u4a24`) is blocked until those tasks close, so PH5
  cannot silently complete with PROP-Srs-001.S6 undone (P8).

## PLAN-Srs-001.P6 Validation strategy

- **Per-slice (Done-when gate):** cold `clojure -M:test <owned namespaces>` for
  the exact namespaces a slice owns. Warm-REPL output satisfies no gate.
- **Language/tooling gates:** `(cd cli && go test ./...)` (PH3), `make api-docs`
  after any batteries/`skein.api.*` docstring change (PH4),
  `make fmt-check lint reflect-check docs-check` held at zero findings.
- **Queue acceptance (PH5):** full locked suite under the flock
  (`flock -w 3600 /tmp/skein-test.lock clojure -M:test`), `clojure -M:smoke`,
  `make spool-suite-gate`, all quality gates green, and clean
  `git status --short` (no generated SQLite/runtime artifacts).
- **End-to-end fresh-repo smoke (PH5):** with binaries rebuilt from the branch
  (`make build`) — `mktemp -d` a repo, `git init`, `./bin/mill init`, start a
  weaver in that disposable world, confirm `strand help` shows the batteries op
  surface via the seeded coordinate, and `strand spool status` shows the
  batteries root resolved through the `:skein/source-root` coordinate (not a
  classpath provider). Every weaver experiment uses a disposable `--workspace` world; the
  canonical `.skein` world is never touched by tests.

## PLAN-Srs-001.P7 Risks

- **Live-weaver / pickup ladder.** The canonical weaver runs OLD code for the
  life of the branch; the PH2 `.skein` migration is inert for it until the user
  restarts it on new code. `:skein/source-root` is a new sync-engine capability,
  so an old canonical weaver cannot parse the migrated `spools.edn` — a `refresh!`
  alone would fault on the unknown kind. Picking up this branch's `.skein` change
  is a JVM-level/new-generation event (rebuilt binaries + restart), not a
  config-only `refresh!`. Per CLAUDE.md hard rules, no feature task restarts or
  refreshes the canonical weaver; the restart is the user's call at landing.
  Record this in Developer Notes at PH2 landing.
- **`:reflect-check` loses batteries.** `spools/batteries/src` rides base
  `deps.edn :paths` today, which is why `:reflect-check` (which composes
  extra-paths without `:test`) sees it without listing it. Removing batteries from
  base `:paths` drops it from reflect-check unless PH2 adds
  `spools/batteries/src` to `:reflect-check :extra-paths`. `make reflect-check`
  is a zero-findings gate, so missing this reddens acceptance. `:format`/`:lint`/
  `:splint` already list batteries explicitly and are unaffected.
- **Test-JVM classpath vs synced-coordinate ownership (decided — see PH2).**
  Keeping `spools/batteries/src` on `:test :extra-paths` (for batteries_test)
  means the `:test` JVM still sees batteries as base-classpath, so
  `loaded-namespace-status` in that JVM still classifies an un-synced batteries as
  `:base-classpath`. The `spools_test` classpath-ownership assertion (~1983–1995)
  and the honest post-cutover behavior (batteries loads through a synced
  coordinate, provider wins) therefore cannot both be proven from the ambient
  `:test` classpath — the synced-batteries behavior is validated from a
  disposable world / the PH5 e2e smoke, and PH2 keeps the ambient-JVM
  assertion reworded as a test-tooling artifact (decision recorded in PH2 and
  reflected in SPEC-004-D006.C7).
- **Doc/spec drift under parallelism.** PH4 fans across many disjoint doc files;
  the delta→root-spec promotion (C50a replacement, C50b addition, C94a.1) is the
  contractual part and should be one reviewer's responsibility even if the
  surrounding spool-doc rewording splits into sibling slices.
- **`make spool-suite-gate` timing.** Source-root resolution binds to the running
  checkout; the pinned external spool suites run against this checkout, so the
  gate should stay green throughout (no external spool consumes the new kind).
  If a sibling `..` root elsewhere names something that is *not* a shipped skein
  spool, proposal G4 says surface it with a recommendation, never silently
  convert — that judgement is the coordinator's during the PH5 sweep.

## PLAN-Srs-001.P8 Task context

Workers receive: the four deltas as the binding contract; the brief's decision
record and consumer sweep; TEN-000@1 (breaking, no migration) and TEN-003 (loud
failure) as the license; and the file-ownership boundaries in P5 (PH1 owns the
core namespaces + its own new test file and must not touch `deps.edn`/
`spools_test`/`config_test`; PH2 owns the repo build/config + those two tests +
smoke fixtures; PH3 owns `cli/` only; PH4 owns specs/docs). Sibling PH-parallel
tasks never share a file. The staging rule is absolute: disposable `--workspace`
worlds and repo-local `./bin` binaries from `make build` for every runtime
experiment; never restart or refresh the canonical weaver; kill by PID only.

**Coordinator-owned follow-ups (tracked as kanban tasks under card `u4a24`,
blocking feature finish):** the sibling-repo `.skein` sweeps (proposal G4/S6) —
each sibling repo's `..` (or `~`) local roots that resolve to spools shipped in
the skein checkout migrate to `:skein/source-root` and land to that repo's own
main, worked in that repo's checkout; any sibling `..` root naming something
else is surfaced to the user with a recommendation (git pin or relocation), not
converted. Survey of 2026-07-23: `devflow.spool` (guild, workflow via
`../../skein-src/`; its own `codethread/devflow {:local/root ".."}` stays —
repo-internal and portable), `kanban.spool` (guild), `dresser.spool` (guild),
`notes` (workflow via `~/dev/projects/skein-src/...`). These depend on this
branch landing so the migrated coordinate resolves.

## PLAN-Srs-001.P9 Developer Notes

- 2026-07-23 (planner jc1jz): sequencing conflict surfaced for the coordinator —
  PH1 and PH2 both need `test/skein/spools_test.clj`, and PH2 additionally needs
  `test/skein/config_test.clj`, so PH1's kind coverage lands in a dedicated new
  test namespace to keep PH1↔PH2 file-disjoint; the two batteries-specific
  assertions stay PH2's. Recorded as a strand note.
- 2026-07-23 (planner jc1jz): three concrete implementation risks the deltas do
  not spell out — reflect-check losing batteries, the test-JVM-classpath vs
  synced-ownership tension, and the pickup-ladder implication that this branch's
  `.skein` migration needs a full restart (not `refresh!`) because the new kind
  is a sync-engine capability. Captured in P7. No disagreement with the deltas
  themselves — they are internally consistent and implementable as written.
