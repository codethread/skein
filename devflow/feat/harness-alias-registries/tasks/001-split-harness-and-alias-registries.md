# Task 1: Split harness and alias registries with alias-first resolution

**Document ID:** `TASK-HarnessAliasRegistries-001`

## TASK-HarnessAliasRegistries-001.P1 Scope

Type: AFK

Engine phase PLAN-HarnessAliasRegistries-001.PH1 in
`skein.spools.shuttle`: tools and seats stop sharing one registry.

## TASK-HarnessAliasRegistries-001.P2 Must implement exactly

- **TASK-HarnessAliasRegistries-001.MI1:** Spool-state gains
  `:alias-registry (atom {})` beside `:harness-registry`; `state-version`
  bumps 2→3. `defharness!` writes only the harness registry, `defalias!`
  only the alias registry; re-registration within a registry replaces, and
  the same name may exist in both registries at once.
- **TASK-HarnessAliasRegistries-001.MI2:** `migrate-state` splits a
  preserved mixed `:harness-registry` into the two atoms, asserting each
  entry matches exactly one shape (alias: `:alias-of` present; harness:
  `:argv` present) and failing loudly with the offending entry in
  `ex-data` when an entry matches neither or both.
- **TASK-HarnessAliasRegistries-001.MI3:** `resolve-harness` and the
  listing's root walk share one lookup rule: prefer an unvisited alias,
  else the harness registry, else fail. `alias pi -> harness pi`
  terminates at the tool. Missing names keep `:error-class
  "harness-not-found"` (recovery deferral keys off it) and now list both
  registries' available names; a genuine alias cycle fails with a
  distinct error that is NOT classed `harness-not-found`.
- **TASK-HarnessAliasRegistries-001.MI4:** `harnesses` returns the
  concatenation of both registries' entries sorted by name — never merged
  by name first, or the same-name shadow pair would silently collapse to
  one row (a same-named tool and seat both appear; `:kind`
  distinguishes) — and alias entries keep carrying
  `:harness`/`:harness-doc` resolved via the new rule, still best-effort
  (broken chains omit the keys rather than failing the listing).
- **TASK-HarnessAliasRegistries-001.MI5:** `register-default-harnesses!`
  keeps its keep-existing semantics against the harness registry.
  `defharness!`/`defalias!`/ns docstrings state the two-registry contract
  and resolution order.
- **TASK-HarnessAliasRegistries-001.MI7:** Registry entry shapes become
  clojure.specs that validation actually consults: `::harness-def` and
  `::alias-def` data specs, checked by `defharness!`/`defalias!` and by
  the migrate split's exactly-one-shape assertion, replacing the
  equivalent hand-rolled structural checks. Keep manual checks only for
  what a spec cannot express (closed key sets already enforced, resume
  argv placeholder membership, cross-registry semantics), and reference
  each spec from its owning docstring.
- **TASK-HarnessAliasRegistries-001.MI6:** Tests in
  `test/skein/shuttle_test.clj`: same-name shadow resolves alias-first and
  terminates at the tool; unshadowed harness resolves directly; alias
  cycle fails with the non-not-found error; missing name fails
  `harness-not-found` listing both registries; listing union shows both
  same-named entries with root docs on aliases; migration test proving a
  v2-shaped mixed registry splits with nothing dropped and a malformed
  entry fails loudly. Update `state-shape-matches-declared-version` for
  v3.

## TASK-HarnessAliasRegistries-001.P3 Done when

- **TASK-HarnessAliasRegistries-001.DW1:** Targeted namespaces green:
  `skein.shuttle-test`, `skein.config-test`, `skein.agents-test` (runner
  has no filter — use the inline `:focus` alias override from
  PLAN-HarnessAliasRegistries-001.TC1).
- **TASK-HarnessAliasRegistries-001.DW2:** `make fmt-check lint
  reflect-check` clean; `make api-docs` regenerated if any public
  docstring changed; `git status --short` free of runtime artifacts.
- **TASK-HarnessAliasRegistries-001.DW3:** Work committed on
  `harness-alias-registries` in this worktree (atomic commits, why-focused
  messages, HEREDOC), status set implemented; do not close the strand, do
  not land.

## TASK-HarnessAliasRegistries-001.P4 Out of scope

- **TASK-HarnessAliasRegistries-001.OS1:** Any `.skein` config change,
  the `pi-main`→`worker` rename, doc/README/cookbook sweep, surface
  baseline, and full-suite/smoke runs — task 2 and land discipline own
  those.
