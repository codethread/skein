## PLAN-HarnessAliasRegistries-001.P1 Goal and scope

Deliver PROP-HarnessAliasRegistries-001: shuttle keeps tools (`defharness!`)
and seats (`defalias!`) in separate registries with alias-first resolution
and lawful same-name shadowing, and the repo roster renames `pi-main` to
`worker` so `pi` reverts to meaning the tool.

## PLAN-HarnessAliasRegistries-001.P2 Approach

- **PLAN-HarnessAliasRegistries-001.A1:** All engine work lands in
  `skein.spools.shuttle`; no other namespace reaches the registry directly
  (agents spool passes names through). Split the single `:harness-registry`
  spool-state atom into `:harness-registry` (tools) and `:alias-registry`
  (seats): `defharness!` and `defalias!` each write their own atom,
  within-registry re-registration still replaces (reload idempotency).
- **PLAN-HarnessAliasRegistries-001.A2:** `resolve-harness` and the listing's
  root walk adopt one lookup rule: prefer an unvisited alias, else the
  harness registry, else fail loudly with both registries' available names
  in `ex-data`. The visited set makes `alias pi -> harness pi` terminate at
  the tool while a genuine alias cycle still fails — and the cycle failure
  stays a distinct error from `harness-not-found`: recovery deferral keys
  off the not-found class, and a cycle collapsing into it would let a real
  configuration bug masquerade as a transient reload race.
- **PLAN-HarnessAliasRegistries-001.A3:** Spool-state shape version bumps
  2→3. `migrate-state` splits a preserved mixed registry into the two new
  atoms, asserting each entry matches exactly one valid shape (alias:
  `:alias-of` present; harness: `:argv` present) and failing loudly with
  the offending entry in `ex-data` rather than misclassifying a corrupt
  record; the `state-shape-matches-declared-version` test keeps version
  and shape honest.
- **PLAN-HarnessAliasRegistries-001.A4:** Sequencing: engine + tests first
  (independently reviewable), then the roster/docs sweep which depends on
  shadowing being lawful.

| ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| PLAN-HarnessAliasRegistries-001.AA1   | `spools/shuttle/src/skein/spools/shuttle.clj` | registry split, resolution rule, listing union, state v3 + migrate       |
| PLAN-HarnessAliasRegistries-001.AA2   | `test/skein/shuttle_test.clj`                 | shadow/coexistence/migration coverage; registry test updates             |
| PLAN-HarnessAliasRegistries-001.AA3   | `.skein/harnesses.clj`, `.skein/config.clj`, `.skein/init.clj` | `worker` seat replaces `pi-main`; doc-string/comment sweep |
| PLAN-HarnessAliasRegistries-001.AA4   | `spools/shuttle/README.md`, `spools/shuttle/treadle.md`, `spools/shuttle.cookbook.md`, `spools/agents/README.md` | two-registry contract, resolution order, renamed examples |
| PLAN-HarnessAliasRegistries-001.AA5   | `test/skein/config_test.clj`, `test/skein/surface_baseline.edn`, `spools/*.api.md` | fixture rename, golden baseline, regenerated api docs |

## PLAN-HarnessAliasRegistries-001.P4 Contract and migration impact

- **PLAN-HarnessAliasRegistries-001.CM1:** Spool-contract change only
  (shuttle README owns it). `harnesses` listing gains no new keys; it may
  now contain a harness and an alias with the same name (kind
  distinguishes). Runtime state migration is internal (A3). Workspace
  configs that relied on silent same-name overwrite (none known) change
  behavior: the harness survives and the alias shadows it.

## PLAN-HarnessAliasRegistries-001.P5 Implementation phases

### PLAN-HarnessAliasRegistries-001.PH1 Engine split

Outcome: two registries with alias-first resolution, lawful shadowing,
state v3 migration, and shuttle tests proving shadow, cycle, missing-name,
listing union, and mixed-registry migration behavior — green on targeted
namespaces.

### PLAN-HarnessAliasRegistries-001.PH2 Roster and docs sweep

Outcome: `worker` seat registered, `pi-main` gone from config, docs,
tests, golden baseline, and regenerated api docs; shuttle README documents
the two-registry contract; config tests green.

## PLAN-HarnessAliasRegistries-001.P6 Validation strategy

- **PLAN-HarnessAliasRegistries-001.V1:** Targeted namespaces
  (`skein.shuttle-test`, `skein.config-test`, `skein.agents-test`) green
  per phase; full `clojure -M:test` under the flock lock plus
  `clojure -M:smoke`, `make fmt-check lint reflect-check docs-check` before
  review/land.
- **PLAN-HarnessAliasRegistries-001.V2:** Migration proven by test:
  a v2-shaped state map with mixed entries migrates into split registries
  with nothing dropped, and a malformed entry (neither or both shapes)
  fails the migration loudly — regression test for each.
- **PLAN-HarnessAliasRegistries-001.V3:** Live smoke in a disposable
  workspace: spawn via seat name, via unshadowed harness name, and via a
  same-named shadow alias.

## PLAN-HarnessAliasRegistries-001.P7 Risks and open questions

- **PLAN-HarnessAliasRegistries-001.R1:** Landing on main renames the
  live coordination world's preferred delegation seat; until the canonical
  weaver reloads config, running references to `pi-main` (e.g. treadle
  gates, retry of old runs) must still resolve. Mitigation: land, reload
  via the sanctioned ladder promptly, and re-check `strand ready --query
  stalled-gates`; old failed runs re-delegated rather than retried if
  their alias is gone.
- **PLAN-HarnessAliasRegistries-001.R2:** Hidden `pi-main` references
  beyond the greppable sweep (durable strand attributes such as
  `shuttle/harness` on historical runs). These are records, not lookups —
  only re-spawn paths resolve names; acceptable, noted for R1 handling.

## PLAN-HarnessAliasRegistries-001.P8 Task context

- **PLAN-HarnessAliasRegistries-001.TC1:** Registry mechanics live at
  `spools/shuttle/src/skein/spools/shuttle.clj` (~lines 80–160 spool-state
  version/migrate, ~349–534 defharness!/defalias!/resolve-harness/harnesses
  listing/register-default-harnesses!). The listing's alias entries must
  keep carrying `:harness`/`:harness-doc` from the root walk. Run targeted
  namespaces via an inline alias override (the `:test` alias's runner takes
  no namespace filter): `clojure -Sdeps '{:aliases {:focus {:main-opts
  ["-e" "..."]}}}' -M:test:focus`. Never run `make install`; never restart
  the canonical weaver; disposable workspaces only for live smoke.
