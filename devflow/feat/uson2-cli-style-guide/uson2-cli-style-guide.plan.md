## PLAN-Ucs-001.P1 Goal and scope

Ship the approved three-part affordance for consistent spool CLIs: a concise
authoring guide, four reusable arg-spec fragments, and dispatch-owned operation
labels for declared subcommands. The proposal owns the motivation and settled
scope. This plan owns sequencing, collision handling, migration, and validation.

The guide section is authored advice in
`docs/spools/writing-shared-spools.md`, not a root-spec contract. Its sole MUST
points authors at existing declared-parser behavior for text-bearing inputs;
it does not create another parser rule. The durable changes are only the Alpha
helper accretion and registered-op result semantics in the two linked deltas.

## PLAN-Ucs-001.P2 Approach

- **PLAN-Ucs-001.A1:** Add the style section beside the existing discovery
  section and link to the authoritative discovery-tier reference. State the
  role-based verb sets, shared flag names, collection split, positive op-shape
  rule, payload-reference MUST, and fix-on-touch policy without restating
  `help`/`about`/`prime`.
- **PLAN-Ucs-001.A2:** Add `note-surface`, `work-root`, `timeout-secs`, and
  `outcome` as documented public data in `skein.api.spool.alpha`. They are
  partial arg-spec maps composed through ordinary data merging. Tests pin their
  declared shapes and demonstrate composition with a spool-owned field; the
  parser gains no special flag types.
- **PLAN-Ucs-001.A3:** Stamp map results in `skein.api.weaver.alpha/op!`, after
  the handler returns and only when parsed args contain `:subcommand`. Derive
  the label from the canonical registered op name and selected subcommand. If a
  map already contains the exact label, preserve it; if it contains any other
  value, fail loudly with expected and actual values. Flat/raw ops, non-map
  results, failures, streams' emitted items, and the help alias stay unchanged.
- **PLAN-Ucs-001.A4:** Migrate only collisions required by the new boundary.
  The in-repo `agent spend` and `land` subcommand paths currently emit
  `agent-spend` and `land-*`; remove those hand-written labels now so dispatch
  produces `agent spend` and `land <verb>`. `roster about|prime` and
  `bench about` already emit the canonical value, so equal-label tolerance
  keeps them working and fix-on-touch defers their cleanup. Flat repo-config
  projections remain handler-labelled because no subcommand was selected.
- **PLAN-Ucs-001.A5:** Keep external kanban changes outside this feature.
  Feature card `m5u47` owns its upstream branch and the paired `deps.edn` and
  `.skein/spools.edn` pin machinery. Its fix-on-touch work removes kanban's
  hand-written `:operation` labels while changing the note surface. This plan
  neither edits kanban nor advances its pins.

## PLAN-Ucs-001.P3 Affected areas

| ID | Area | Expected change |
| -- | ---- | --------------- |
| PLAN-Ucs-001.AA1 | `docs/spools/writing-shared-spools.md` | Add the advisory CLI style section beside discovery. |
| PLAN-Ucs-001.AA2 | Spool Alpha API, focused test, generated API doc | Add and test the four public data fragments. |
| PLAN-Ucs-001.AA3 | `src/skein/api/weaver/alpha.clj`, `test/skein/weaver_test.clj` | Stamp declared-subcommand map results and reject conflicting labels. |
| PLAN-Ucs-001.AA4 | Agent/delegation spools, land workflow, tests | Remove mismatching labels and update expectations. |
| PLAN-Ucs-001.AA5 | External kanban handoff (`m5u47`) | No uson2 change; the sibling card owns upstream cleanup and paired pin movement. |
| PLAN-Ucs-001.AA6 | `devflow/specs/alpha-surface.md`, `devflow/specs/daemon-runtime.md` | Promote `DELTA-Ucs-001` and `DELTA-Ucs-002` when the feature ships. |

## PLAN-Ucs-001.P4 Contract and migration impact

- **PLAN-Ucs-001.CM1:** `DELTA-Ucs-001` accretes four values within the already
  blessed `skein.api.spool.alpha` tier. Their names and data shapes become Alpha
  compatibility commitments.
- **PLAN-Ucs-001.CM2:** `DELTA-Ucs-002` changes `SPEC-004.C63b`: declared
  subcommand map results gain a canonical operation label, and conflicting
  handler labels become loud failures.
- **PLAN-Ucs-001.CM3:** No `cli.md` delta is genuine. `SPEC-002.C37` already
  contracts payload-reference resolution through the blessed parser, and the
  dispatcher continues to relay the weaver result. No argv, envelope,
  transport, or public command changes.
- **PLAN-Ucs-001.CM4:** No stored-data migration or compatibility alias ships.
  The observable `agent-spend` and `land-*` result labels move directly to
  `agent spend` and `land <verb>` under TEN-000. Flat op labels do not move.

## PLAN-Ucs-001.P5 Implementation slices

Each slice fits one worker context. S1, S2, and S3 may proceed in parallel. S4
and S5 depend on S3. Feature acceptance waits for all five.

### PLAN-Ucs-001.S1 Style-guide section

- **Depends-on:** none.
- **Owned files:** `docs/spools/writing-shared-spools.md`.
- **Outcome:** The shared-spool guide contains the approved role-based verb
  sets, flag lexicon, collection split, positive op-shape recommendation,
  payload-reference MUST, and fix-on-touch policy. It links to the existing
  discovery tiers and clearly marks naming advice as advisory.
- **Validation:** `make docs-check`.
- **Done-when:** All brief points appear once, the discovery contract is linked
  rather than copied, the docs-style sweep is clean, and `make docs-check`
  passes.

### PLAN-Ucs-001.S2 Composable arg-spec fragments

- **Depends-on:** none.
- **Owned files:** `src/skein/api/spool/alpha.clj`,
  `test/skein/api/spool_test.clj`, generated `docs/api/spool.api.md`.
- **Outcome:** Four public, documented partial arg-spec maps cover note input,
  work-root flags, `--timeout-secs`, and `--outcome`. Tests pin the data and show
  a fragment composed with domain-owned declarations.
- **Validation:** `clojure -M:test skein.api.spool-test`; `make api-docs`;
  `make docs-check`.
- **Done-when:** Public vars have useful docstrings, no parser code changes,
  the cold focused namespace passes, and generated API docs are current.

### PLAN-Ucs-001.S3 Dispatch-owned operation labels

- **Depends-on:** none.
- **Owned files:** `src/skein/api/weaver/alpha.clj`,
  `test/skein/weaver_test.clj`.
- **Outcome:** Declared-subcommand map results receive `<op> <subcommand>` at
  dispatch. Tests cover absent, equal, and conflicting labels plus unchanged
  flat/raw/non-map/help behavior. Equal existing labels remain unchanged.
- **Validation:** `clojure -M:test skein.weaver-test`; `make api-docs` if public
  docstrings change; `make docs-check`.
- **Done-when:** Dispatch stamps absent labels, preserves equal labels, rejects
  disagreements, leaves excluded paths unchanged, and the cold focused
  namespace passes.

### PLAN-Ucs-001.S4 Agent operation-label migration

- **Depends-on:** S3.
- **Owned files:** the agent spend producer and its focused delegation and
  agent-run tests.
- **Outcome:** Agent spend stops emitting `agent-spend`; dispatch supplies
  `agent spend`, and both direct and agent-run consumers expect that form.
- **Validation:** `clojure -M:test skein.delegation-test
  skein.agent-run-test`; `make api-docs` if public docstrings change; `make
  docs-check`.
- **Done-when:** The hand-written mismatch is gone and both cold focused
  namespaces pass.

### PLAN-Ucs-001.S5 Land operation-label migration

- **Depends-on:** S3.
- **Owned files:** `.skein/workflows.clj` and its operation-label assertions.
- **Outcome:** Land subcommands stop emitting `land-*`; dispatch supplies
  `land <verb>` while flat repo-config projections remain handler-labelled.
- **Validation:** `clojure -M:test skein.config-test`; `make docs-check`.
- **Done-when:** No land subcommand emits a mismatching label and the cold
  focused namespace passes.

## PLAN-Ucs-001.P6 Validation strategy

- **PLAN-Ucs-001.V1:** Use each slice's named cold focused namespace as its
  Done-when gate. Warm runs may iterate but never satisfy the gate.
- **PLAN-Ucs-001.V2:** Regenerate `docs/api/spool.api.md` after fragment
  docstrings and any affected spool API docs after label cleanup. `make
  docs-check` must pass after each documentation-affecting slice.
- **PLAN-Ucs-001.V3:** Run `make fmt-check lint reflect-check` once all source
  slices are assembled.
- **PLAN-Ucs-001.V4:** The full locked Clojure suite runs only at land-time,
  alongside `(cd cli && go test ./...)`, `clojure -M:smoke`,
  `make spool-suite-gate`, and the blocking quality gates.
- **PLAN-Ucs-001.V5:** End validation with `git status --short`; no generated
  SQLite or runtime metadata may remain.

## PLAN-Ucs-001.P7 Risks and open questions

- **PLAN-Ucs-001.R1:** Pinned kanban's `task add|list` labels disagree with the
  approved one-level `<op> <subcommand>` rule. Feature card `m5u47` owns the
  upstream fix-on-touch cleanup and paired pin movement. Keep that work outside
  these slices; do not weaken the fail-loud boundary or add a kanban-specific
  exception here.
- **PLAN-Ucs-001.R2:** A handler may return a collection or scalar, which cannot
  carry `:operation` without a breaking wrapper shape. Mitigation: stamp maps
  only, as `DELTA-Ucs-002.CC1` states, and leave other result shapes unchanged.
- **PLAN-Ucs-001.Q1:** None. Collision semantics and migration scope are
  resolved above.

## PLAN-Ucs-001.P8 Task context

- **PLAN-Ucs-001.TC1:** The approved source is `PROP-Ucs-001`; do not reopen the
  parser-level type system, compatibility aliases, output specs, or rename-only
  migrations rejected there.
- **PLAN-Ucs-001.TC2:** The parser already resolves whole-value `:stdin` and
  `:payload/<name>` references recursively. The style-guide MUST tells authors
  to use that declared path for text-bearing inputs; no parser change belongs
  in this feature.
- **PLAN-Ucs-001.TC3:** Derive labels from the canonical registry entry and the
  parsed `:subcommand`, not raw argv. Use `contains?` to distinguish an absent
  handler label from an explicit nil disagreement.
- **PLAN-Ucs-001.TC4:** For pinned kanban evidence, cite
  `kanban.spool@03707e5/<path>`, resolved at
  `~/.gitlibs/libs/io.github.codethread/kanban.spool/03707e525185cbd5685522a45c6e779b22ceb6b8/<path>`.
- **PLAN-Ucs-001.TC5:** Equal hand-written labels are compatible but still
  duplicate dispatch knowledge. Remove them when their owning surface is next
  changed; this feature removes only the in-repo disagreements assigned to S4
  and S5.

## PLAN-Ucs-001.P9 Developer Notes

Append notes here. Do not rewrite earlier notes.

### PLAN-Ucs-001.DN1 Plan creation — 2026-07-14

Root-spec review found two genuine deltas. `SPEC-005.C3` enumerates the
`skein.api.spool.alpha` helpers, and `SPEC-004.C63b` says handler results are
transported without the new operation-label rule. `cli.md` remains true, and
the style section is authored guidance rather than a durable root contract.

### PLAN-Ucs-001.DN2 Review corrections and kanban handoff — 2026-07-14

`SPEC-005.C2`, not C3, owns the blessed `skein.api.spool.alpha` surface; DN1's
earlier citation is superseded. External kanban work is handed to sibling
feature card `m5u47`, which already owns a kanban.spool branch and the paired
pin-bump machinery. Its note-surface change will remove kanban's hand-written
`:operation` labels as fix-on-touch work. The uson2 feature does not edit
kanban.spool or advance its pins.

### PLAN-Ucs-001.DN3 Agent-run validation correction — 2026-07-14

Task 4's named focused command is rejected before execution because
`skein.agent-run-test` belongs to add-libs shard B and is not focused-runnable.
The slice gate used the focused-runnable downstream
`clojure -M:test skein.delegation-test` plus cold shard B through
`clojure -M:test --shard B --summary-file <file>`. This exercises the direct
delegation surface and the authoritative agent-run suite without running the
full locked test suite, which remains land-time work.
