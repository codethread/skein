## PROP-Ucs-001.P1 Problem

Shared spools expose related concepts under different verbs, flags, and result
labels. The inconsistency makes a cold agent learn each spool independently and
encourages each new spool to coin another local convention. The current examples
include kanban note attribution as `--author`, while the batteries and agent note
surfaces use `--by`; roster closes with `--status` and `--result`, while kanban
closes with `--outcome`; and roster expresses its wait bound in milliseconds,
while agent uses `--timeout-secs`.

The underlying surfaces already contain most of the right pieces:

- The shared-spool guide is organized around explicit runtime, runtime-owned
  state, symbolic registration, fail-loud helpers, timing, and attribute deltas
  (`docs/spools/writing-shared-spools.md:14-105`). It documents the blessed
  helper namespaces at `docs/spools/writing-shared-spools.md:113-179`, then the
  generated `help`, authored `about`, and run-first `prime` discovery surface at
  `docs/spools/writing-shared-spools.md:181-199`. The user reference owns the
  fuller discovery-tier contract and its source-of-truth split
  (`docs/reference.md:268-301`). The style guide belongs beside, and points back
  to, that existing discovery section.
- `skein.api.spool.alpha` is already the blessed home for small shared
  spool-authoring affordances (`src/skein/api/spool/alpha.clj:1-21`). Its current
  surface includes `fail!`, `reject-unknown-keys!`, `require-valid!`,
  `attr-key->str`, `poll-until-deadline!`, and `attr-get`
  (`src/skein/api/spool/alpha.clj:23-134`). Arg-spec fragments fit that same
  data-first authoring role.
- The declared arg-spec DSL already models flags, positionals, one level of
  subcommands, and payload references (`src/skein/api/cli/alpha.clj:11-51`).
  Subcommand parsing selects the nested spec and adds the selected verb as
  `:subcommand` (`src/skein/api/cli/alpha.clj:410-427`); `parse` returns that map
  to the registered-op layer (`src/skein/api/cli/alpha.clj:429-445`). Payload
  references are resolved across parsed strings, vectors, and maps before the
  handler runs (`src/skein/api/cli/alpha.clj:324-359`). A text-bearing argument
  that bypasses this path therefore loses existing correctness behavior rather
  than choosing a different style.
- Registered-op dispatch places parsed args in `:op/args`, invokes the handler,
  and currently returns the handler value unchanged
  (`src/skein/api/weaver/alpha.clj:416-453`). That is the result boundary where
  the selected op name and parsed subcommand are both known. Today handlers
  stamp `:operation` themselves. Pinned kanban does so for `add`, `promote`,
  `priority`, `claim`, `review`, `rework`, `finish`, `task add`, `task list`,
  `note`, `card`, `board`, `about`, `prime`, and `next` (pinned
  `kanban.spool@03707e5/src/ct/spools/kanban.clj:173-175,274-360,494-566,838-949,1049-1125,1276`;
  the pin is declared at `deps.edn:20-27`), roster does so for `about` and
  `prime` (`spools/roster/src/skein/spools/roster.clj:571-623`), bench for
  `about` (`spools/bench/src/skein/spools/bench.clj:1191-1199`), agent for
  `spend` (`spools/agent-run/src/skein/spools/agent_run.clj:2218-2245`), and the
  repo's land handler for `about`, `start`, `next`, `complete`, `choose`,
  `status`, and `break-lock` (`.skein/workflows.clj:512-630`).
  Flat repo-config projections also hand-roll the key: `feature-costs`,
  `current-dags`, `kanban-tree`, `kanban-export`, the `devflow-*` family,
  `workflow-runs`, `flow-status`, `hitl`, and `branches`
  (`.skein/analytics.clj:156-159`; `.skein/config.clj:121,209,315-536,671,755,789`;
  pinned `kanban.spool@03707e5/src/ct/spools/kanban.clj:1330`). They have no
  selected subcommand and are not part of automatic dispatch labeling.

This feature separates correctness from guidance. Declared parsing for
text-bearing inputs is the one requirement. Naming guidance remains advisory,
supported by reusable data and applied when a surface is otherwise changing.
That follows the repo rule that load-bearing conventions live in code while
prose explains them (`devflow/PHILOSOPHY.md:27-35`).

## PROP-Ucs-001.P2 Goals

- **PROP-Ucs-001.G1:** Give shared-spool authors one concise vocabulary for
  choosing domain verbs, shared flags, duration units, and collection names,
  anchored to the existing `help`/`about`/`prime` discovery contract.
- **PROP-Ucs-001.G2:** State one correctness rule: every text-bearing flag or
  positional uses the declared arg-spec parser, so whole-value `:stdin` and
  `:payload/<name>` references resolve. Hand-written parsing that drops this
  behavior is a bug.
- **PROP-Ucs-001.G3:** Make the common note, work-root, timeout, and closing
  declarations reusable as plain arg-spec data in `skein.api.spool.alpha`.
- **PROP-Ucs-001.G4:** Make subcommand result maps carry
  `:operation "<spool> <full-subcommand-path>"` from dispatch-owned context
  rather than requiring every handler to repeat the label.
- **PROP-Ucs-001.G5:** Apply advisory naming guidance fix-on-touch. Existing
  working surfaces do not move merely to match the guide.

## PROP-Ucs-001.P3 Non-goals

- **PROP-Ucs-001.NG1:** No rename-only churn. This proposal does not bulk-rename
  existing ops, verbs, flags, or result fields.
- **PROP-Ucs-001.NG2:** No parser-level flag type system. The parser remains a
  domain-neutral argv and payload-reference parser; shared domain shapes are
  ordinary data in `skein.api.spool.alpha`.
- **PROP-Ucs-001.NG3:** No compatibility aliases. When an outlier is changed for
  a substantive reason, the old spelling is dropped under TEN-000
  (`devflow/TENETS.md:3-4`), not retained beside the replacement.
- **PROP-Ucs-001.NG4:** No hard conformance gate for advisory vocabulary, and no
  per-op result-spec system. The only MUST concerns payload-reference
  correctness.
- **PROP-Ucs-001.NG5:** No restatement or redesign of `help`, `about`, or
  `prime`; their existing discovery contract remains authoritative.
- **PROP-Ucs-001.NG6:** No change to flat single-purpose projections or
  config-registered ops solely to group them under subcommands.

## PROP-Ucs-001.P4 Scope

### PROP-Ucs-001.S1 Shared-spool CLI style guide

Add a section to `docs/spools/writing-shared-spools.md`, adjacent to its current
discovery surface (`docs/spools/writing-shared-spools.md:181-199`). It covers:

- entity lifecycle: `start`, `finish --outcome`, `abort` only for real teardown,
  `status <id>`, and `list`;
- workflow steps: `start`, `next`, `complete`, `choose`, and `status`;
- processes: `spawn`, `kill`, `retry`, `await`, `logs`, and `ps`;
- `--by` for attribution; attribute-stamping flags named after their attribute
  (`--owner`, `--branch`, `--worktree`, `--feature`); seconds-first,
  unit-suffixed durations such as `--timeout-secs`; and `--outcome` for closing
  state;
- `list` for live, filterable work entities and a plural noun for a fixed
  catalog such as `harnesses`, `suites`, or `backends`;
- one op with declared subcommands for a cohesive multi-verb domain, while
  single-purpose projections and config-registered ops stay flat;
- the payload-reference MUST and the fix-on-touch policy.

The section links to the discovery-tier reference rather than repeating it. All
naming points other than payload-reference plumbing are recommendations.

### PROP-Ucs-001.S2 Composable arg-spec fragments

Extend `skein.api.spool.alpha` with four plain-data fragments: note surface,
work root, `timeout-secs`, and outcome. Spool authors can merge them into a
declared arg-spec and add domain-specific fields without teaching the parser
about note, work-root, or lifecycle semantics.

The shapes come from repeated current declarations:

- Batteries declares the flat note target/text positionals plus `--by`,
  `--round`, and decorating `--attr` flags
  (`spools/batteries/src/skein/spools/batteries.clj:470-487`). Agent repeats the
  same note surface inside its subcommands
  (`spools/delegation/src/skein/spools/delegation.clj:2003-2011`). The pinned
  kanban note surface has the same target/text need but locally calls attribution
  `--author` (`kanban.spool@03707e5/src/ct/spools/kanban.clj:1230-1237`).
- Roster repeats `--feature`, `--owner`, `--branch`, and `--worktree` for work
  roots (`spools/roster/src/skein/spools/roster.clj:730-738`); pinned kanban claim
  repeats owner/branch/worktree
  (`kanban.spool@03707e5/src/ct/spools/kanban.clj:1223-1229`).
- Agent already declares `--timeout-secs` as an integer
  (`spools/delegation/src/skein/spools/delegation.clj:1972-1975`), while roster's
  wait surface shows the current millisecond outlier
  (`spools/roster/src/skein/spools/roster.clj:753-758`).
- Pinned kanban already uses `--outcome` for closing
  (`kanban.spool@03707e5/src/ct/spools/kanban.clj:1251-1253`), while roster's
  `finish` declares the overlapping `--status`/`--result` surface
  (`spools/roster/src/skein/spools/roster.clj:741-744`).

These examples establish the common fragment boundaries. They do not authorize
a migration of every consumer in this slice.

### PROP-Ucs-001.S3 Dispatch-owned operation labels

For a registered op whose arg-spec selects a subcommand, stamp the returned
result map with `:operation "<op-name> <full-subcommand-path>"` at the registered-op
result boundary. The parser returns the selected `:subcommand` and any nested
`:action`; registered-op dispatch has that resolved path and the handler result
(`src/skein/api/weaver/alpha.clj:435-453`).

This slice removes the need for subcommand handlers to hand-roll labels and
normalizes current outliers such as `agent-spend` and `land-start` to their
declared command paths. It does not infer verbs for flat ops.

## PROP-Ucs-001.P5 Decision links

The settled scope is recorded in [brief.md](./brief.md). Kanban card `1dw6d`
holds the inventory and review record. Its synthesis note `ce3gj` fixes the
three role-based verb sets, payload-reference plumbing as the sole correctness
MUST, fragments in `skein.api.spool.alpha`, no parser-level flag type system,
dispatch-owned `:operation`, the positive subcommand rule, and fix-on-touch with
no compatibility aliases. This proposal adopts those decisions without
reopening the alternatives considered there.
