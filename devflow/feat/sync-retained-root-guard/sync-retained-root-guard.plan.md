## PLAN-srr-001.P1 Goal and scope

Add one preflight to `sync!` so that when a session-retained `:local/root` spool lib is deleted
from disk **and** has left the approved allowlist, the sync fails loudly — naming the retained lib,
the deleted path, and the stub-or-restart remedies — before the next re-resolving `add-libs`
surfaces the misleading tools.deps canonicalization error that blames the wrong spool. This is the
mitigation half of the "own the spool classpath" concern; the classloader/retained-universe
redesign stays with the separate refinement card. Scope is exactly `PROP-srr-001.S1`–`.S3`: one
preflight, one loud failure, cold focused tests. No loader, classloader, config key, sync-state
field, `use!`, healthy-path, or per-entry `:missing-root` change. Why it matters and the full
alternatives history: [proposal.md](./proposal.md); durable contract change:
[daemon-runtime.delta.md](./specs/daemon-runtime.delta.md).

## PLAN-srr-001.P2 Approach

- **PLAN-srr-001.A1 — retained-root scan factored into a pure detector.** Two private vars in
  `skein.core.weaver.spool-sync`: (1) a pure detector that takes a retained `:libs` map and the
  approved-allowlist set and returns the allowlist-orphan missing roots — each `:libs` entry that
  carries a `:local/root`, whose `io/file` no longer `.exists`, **and** whose lib symbol is absent
  from the allowlist (`approved-spools` `:spools` keys). Its only side input is the on-disk `.exists`
  probe, so it is fully determined by (`:libs` map, allowlist set, filesystem). A nil/empty `:libs`
  yields no orphans (no-op). (2) a thin caller that supplies `(:libs (clojure.java.basis/current-basis))`
  and the shared allowlist to the detector. Reading the basis is pure inspection — neither var calls
  `update-basis!` or otherwise mutates `the-basis` (`DELTA-srr-dr-001.D3`/`PROP-srr-001.NG4`). The
  pure detector is the testability seam that keeps the tests off the live basis (`PLAN-srr-001.AA2`).
- **PLAN-srr-001.A2 — preflight throw at the top of `sync-approved-spools`, allowlist computed once.**
  Compute the approved allowlist once at the top of `sync-approved-spools` and thread it to both the
  preflight and the existing per-entry loop, which recomputes it at `spool_sync.clj:488` today —
  binding once avoids re-reading `spools.edn`/`spools.local.edn` twice per sync. Before the existing
  `(reset! (approved-spool-sync-state runtime) {})` and the per-entry map, run the detector once (A1);
  when it returns a non-empty orphan set, throw an `ex-info` with the message and `ex-data`
  (`:missing-roots`, `:remedy` `{:stub-dir .. :restart ..}`, `:retained-universe-source`) specified
  in `DELTA-srr-dr-001.CC2`. Because the throw precedes the per-entry loop, no partial sync result
  is produced; the exception propagates through `sync!` and the reload path unchanged
  (`SPEC-004.C46`).
- **PLAN-srr-001.A3 — disjoint from the per-entry `:missing-root` path.** The allowlist-orphan
  filter (A1c) is what keeps the preflight from touching still-approved deleted roots, which stay on
  the soft `sync-approved-spool!` `:missing-root` outcome (`spool_sync.clj`, the
  `(not (.exists root-file))` branch). No edit to that branch (`DELTA-srr-dr-001.CC3`).
- **PLAN-srr-001.A4 — no new dependency, no alpha-surface change.** `clojure.java.basis` is already
  on the runtime classpath and `clojure.repl.deps` is already required in `spool-sync`. The
  preflight lives in the internal `skein.core.*` tier (`SPEC-005.C5`) and surfaces through the
  already-blessed `runtime/sync!` (`SPEC-005.C2`) by accretion, so no `alpha-surface.md` delta is
  needed (see `PLAN-srr-001.CM1`).

## PLAN-srr-001.P4 Contract and migration impact

- **PLAN-srr-001.CM1:** One durable contract change — a new loud whole-sync failure mode on
  `sync!` — staged in [daemon-runtime.delta.md](./specs/daemon-runtime.delta.md)
  (`DELTA-srr-dr-001`), amending the `SPEC-004.C43`/`.C44` sync-outcome area. **No
  `alpha-surface.md` (SPEC-005) delta:** the proposal cites `SPEC-005.C2` (`runtime.alpha` blessed)
  and `.C5` (`spool-sync` internal) only as existing code facts; neither classification changes.
  The preflight is added inside the internal `spool-sync` tier and surfaces through the blessed
  `sync!` by accretion, and `SPEC-005` carries no behavioral `sync!` clause (`.C5a` covers only the
  clock/quiescence seams), so there is nothing to delta there. No data model, config key, or CLI
  surface change; no migration.

## PLAN-srr-001.P5 Implementation phases

### PLAN-srr-001.PH1 Retained-root detector and loud-failure preflight

Outcome: `sync!` gains the pure retained-root detector (A1) and the preflight throw (A2). A retained
`:local/root` that has left the allowlist and been deleted from disk aborts the whole sync with an
`ex-info` whose `:missing-roots` names the lib and path and whose `:remedy` names `:stub-dir` and
`:restart`; healthy retained roots and still-approved deleted roots are untouched (A3).

Test the detector directly — never through `add-libs`. Each case builds a **synthetic** `:libs` map
whose `:local/root` points at a temp dir the test owns, sets the allowlist explicitly, controls that
temp dir's on-disk existence, and asserts the returned orphan set (and, for the orphan case, the
`ex-info`/`ex-data` shape built from it per `DELTA-srr-dr-001.CC2`). Because the synthetic root is
never added to the real basis, deleting the temp dir is inherently safe — no `add-libs`, no
`current-basis` mutation, no JVM-global `the-basis` write — so no shard-poisoning hazard exists to
mitigate. Cold focused cases cover: allowlist-orphan fails loudly with the specified `ex-data`;
healthy retained root is a no-op (`PROP-srr-001.G4`); multiple missing roots all reported in
`:missing-roots`; still-approved deleted root excluded (A3, disjoint from the per-entry
`:missing-root` path).

### PLAN-srr-001.PH2 Stub-dir remedy round-trip

Outcome: a cold focused case proves the `:stub-dir` remedy — recreating a bare directory at the
deleted path — clears the orphan, closing the loop on the named remedy. With the pure detector this
is a filesystem existence flip: recreate the temp dir the synthetic `:local/root` points at, re-run
the detector, assert an empty orphan set. If the phase also keeps an end-to-end case that drives the
throw through the live `sync!` (add a real temp root, delete it, drop it from the allowlist), that
case MUST restore a bare stub dir at the deleted path before it yields: the preflight throws before
`add-libs`, so its own run is safe, but the retained coordinate persists in the JVM-global basis for
the process's life and would poison a later genuinely-new `add-libs` in the same JVM (e.g.
`approved-spool-sync-loads-maven-deps-before-activation`). Recreating the bare dir — the `:stub-dir`
remedy itself — lets that later `add-libs` re-canonicalize the retained `:libs` without tripping the
tools.deps error. Prefer the pure detector tests; the live case is optional and, if kept, is bounded
by this stub-restore discipline (`PROP-srr-001.S3`).

## PLAN-srr-001.P6 Validation strategy

- **PLAN-srr-001.V1 (per-slice cold gate):** Each phase gates on the cold focused run
  `clojure -M:test skein.runtime-deps-test` — the touched namespace. Warm (`make test-warm
  NS="skein.runtime-deps-test"`) is for iteration only and never satisfies the gate.
- **PLAN-srr-001.V2 (quality gates):** `make fmt-check lint reflect-check` clean at zero findings
  (the delta touches no docstrings on `skein.api.*.alpha`, so `docs-check`/`make api-docs` are not
  implicated; confirm `docs-check` stays green).
- **PLAN-srr-001.V3 (full suite — acceptance/land only):** The full locked suite
  `flock -w 3600 /tmp/skein-test.lock clojure -M:test` runs only at queue acceptance and at land
  `merge-local-verify`, never as a per-slice gate. No Go, smoke, or api-docs surface changes are
  expected (`PROP-srr-001.S3`).

## PLAN-srr-001.P7 Risks and open questions

- **PLAN-srr-001.R1 — a live-basis test could poison later cases in the same JVM.** The test weaver
  runs an in-process nREPL (`runtime.clj:403`), so any `add-libs` mutates the test JVM's global
  `the-basis`; the leak is to LATER cases in the same JVM/namespace, not to sibling `:test` shards
  (separate JVMs with separate `the-basis`). The chosen technique removes the hazard rather than
  managing it: the detector is tested purely over synthetic bases never added to the real basis
  (PH1), so deleting a synthetic root cannot poison anything. The only residual exposure is the
  optional end-to-end throw case (PH2), bounded by restoring a bare stub dir at the deleted path
  before it yields so the retained coordinate stays resolvable for later `add-libs`.
  `keep-add-libs-root!` is a no-op stub (`runtime_deps_test.clj:21-25`) — the existing tests avoid
  poisoning only by never deleting their temp roots, a technique these deleted-root cases cannot use;
  the pure-detector and stub-restore techniques replace it.
- **PLAN-srr-001.R2 — residual still-approved-deleted-root window.** By design (`DELTA-srr-dr-001.D2`)
  the preflight ignores still-approved deleted roots, so that narrow case can still surface the
  misleading tools.deps error. Accepted limitation; it closes only with the deferred classloader
  redesign. Not in scope here.
- **PLAN-srr-001.Q1:** None blocking task generation.

## PLAN-srr-001.P8 Task context

- **PLAN-srr-001.TC1:** The retained-universe hazard is real and already documented in-repo:
  `test/skein/runtime_deps_test.clj` `keep-add-libs-root!` works *around* it; this feature makes it
  diagnosable. Anchors an implementer needs: `sync-approved-spools` and `approved-spools` (allowlist
  keys) in `src/skein/core/weaver/spool_sync.clj`; the per-entry `:missing-root` branch in
  `sync-approved-spool!` (leave unchanged); `(:libs (clojure.java.basis/current-basis))` as the
  retained universe, the same value `clojure.repl.deps/add-libs` re-canonicalizes. Exact `ex-info`
  shape is in `DELTA-srr-dr-001.CC2`; the four required test cases are in `PROP-srr-001.S3`. Owned
  file scope: `spool_sync.clj` + `runtime_deps_test.clj` only — no Go, smoke, or api-docs surface.

## PLAN-srr-001.P9 Developer Notes

Append notes here. Do not rewrite earlier notes.

### PLAN-srr-001.DN1 Task bu8rq: spec-plan authoring — 2026-07-11

- Spec-surface judgement: exactly one durable contract change (new loud `sync!` failure mode),
  staged as `DELTA-srr-dr-001` on `daemon-runtime.md`. No `alpha-surface.md` delta — argument
  recorded in `PLAN-srr-001.CM1` and in a task note. Verified `SPEC-005.C2`/`.C5`/`.C5a` carry no
  behavioral `sync!` contract to amend.

### PLAN-srr-001.DN2 Task 3euot: test-isolation rewrite (synthesis 434ui M1) — 2026-07-11

- Must-fix M1: the prior R1/PH2/AA2 prescribed "isolated temp world" isolation, which is
  mechanically wrong — the test weaver runs an in-process nREPL (`runtime.clj:403`), so `add-libs`
  poisons the running JVM's global `the-basis`; a temp workspace isolates the dir, not the basis, and
  the leak is to later cases in the same JVM (`:test` shards are separate JVMs), not across shards.
  "Never delete a retained root" was self-contradictory for a feature whose tests must delete one.
- Chosen technique (evidence-based, read against `runtime_deps_test.clj`): factor the scan into a
  pure detector (A1) and test it over **synthetic** `:libs` maps that are never added to the real
  basis, so root deletion is inherently safe and the hazard is removed, not mitigated. Any optional
  end-to-end throw case is bounded by restoring a bare stub dir before yielding. `keep-add-libs-root!`
  stays a no-op stub; the pure-detector approach replaces the retain-don't-delete workaround.
- Nice-to-haves: applied N1 (compute the allowlist once, thread to preflight + loop) in A2. Skipped
  N2 (CC2 message label "session-retained spool root" → "retained local root") — the label lives in
  `DELTA-srr-dr-001.CC2`, which passed review unanimously and is out of this task's owned scope.
