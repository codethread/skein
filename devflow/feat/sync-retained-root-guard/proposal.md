# Sync retained-root guard: fail loudly when a session-retained spool root is deleted

**Document ID:** `PROP-srr-001` **Last Updated:** 2026-07-11 **Related RFCs:** None. **Related brief:**
[brief.md](./brief.md) (scope is the contract) **Kanban:** card `pn7wh` (p2). **Extracted from:**
[`unify-spool-classpath`](../unify-spool-classpath/proposal.md) (`PROP-usc-001`), the "own the spool classpath"
concern — this card is the mitigation; the classloader redesign is that card's. **Related root specs:**
[Weaver Runtime](../../specs/daemon-runtime.md) (SPEC-004, the `spools.edn` allowlist and `sync!` semantics),
[Alpha Surface](../../specs/alpha-surface.md) — SPEC-005.C2 marks `skein.api.runtime.alpha` as blessed API; its
`sync!`/`syncs` delegation to `spool-sync` is a code fact (`alpha.clj:20-28`), and SPEC-005.C5 marks `spool-sync`
(`skein.core.*`) internal and free to change. **Related sources:**
`src/skein/core/weaver/spool_sync.clj` (`sync-approved-spools`, `sync-approved-spool!`,
`add-root-paths-to-spool-loader!`), `src/skein/api/runtime/alpha.clj` (`sync!`, `reload!`),
`src/skein/core/weaver/runtime.clj` (`reload-config!`, `clear-reload-state!`),
`clojure/repl/deps.clj` (`add-libs`), `clojure/java/basis.clj` (`current-basis`),
`clojure/java/basis/impl.clj` (`the-basis`, `update-basis!`), `test/skein/runtime_deps_test.clj`
(`keep-add-libs-root!`).

**Reading context.** A *spool* is trusted authorable Clojure approved in `spools.edn` and loaded into the weaver
by `runtime/sync!`. `sync!` loads each approved `:local/root` by handing it to `clojure.repl.deps/add-libs`, which
mutates a *process-global* runtime basis that persists for the JVM lifetime — the "session" in this document is one
weaver JVM lifetime, and a "session-retained root" is a `:local/root` that any prior `add-libs` in that JVM merged
into that basis. This feature adds one preflight to `sync!` and one loud failure; it changes no loader, no
classloader, and no healthy-path behavior. Every point ID is a grepable anchor; source citations name a stable site
(a fn, a config key) and any `file:line` is secondary, verified at authoring in the `sync-retained-root-guard`
worktree.

## PROP-srr-001.P1 Problem

`skein.api.runtime.alpha/sync!` (`runtime/alpha.clj:20-23`) delegates to
`skein.core.weaver.spool-sync/sync-approved-spools` (`spool_sync.clj:484-493`), which resets skein's
`:approved-spool-sync-state` atom, then maps `sync-approved-spool!` over the approved allowlist. For each approved
local root, `sync-approved-spool!` (`spool_sync.clj:446-482`) calls, inside `with-spool-classloader`:

```clojure
;; spool_sync.clj:466-471
(repl-deps/add-libs {lib {:local/root (:root entry)}})
```

`add-libs` is not a per-lib operation. Its implementation (`clojure/repl/deps.clj:35-57`) reads the current runtime
basis and re-resolves against the **entire retained universe** — but only when there is genuinely-new work to do:

- `clojure/repl/deps.clj:41-45` — it derefs the process-global basis, and **filters the passed coordinates against
  the libs already retained this JVM**, then `(when-not (empty? lib-coords) …)`. An `add-libs` for an already-retained
  lib filters to empty and early-returns without re-resolving; only a genuinely-new coordinate reaches the tool call.
- `clojure/repl/deps.clj:48` — that tool call is `{:existing libs, :add lib-coords, :procurer procurer}` →
  `clojure.tools.deps/resolve-added-libs`. The **whole** retained `:libs` map is passed as `:existing` and
  re-canonicalized alongside the one new coordinate.
- `clojure/repl/deps.clj:53` — `(basis-impl/update-basis! update :libs merge added)` merges the newly-resolved libs
  back into the global basis. `update-basis!` (`clojure/java/basis/impl.clj:48-51`) `swap!`s `@the-basis`, a
  delay-wrapped process-global atom (`impl.clj:44-46`). This is the JVM-lifetime retention: nothing in skein or
  tools.deps evicts a `:local/root` once added.

**The failure.** When a session-retained local root is deleted from disk, the *next* `add-libs` that adds a
not-yet-retained lib — for any spool, including an unrelated one — re-canonicalizes the deleted path while processing
`:existing` and throws. The thrown error names the stale retained lib and its old path, not the spool being synced.
`sync-approved-spool!` catches it into a `:runtime-add-failed` sync result (`spool_sync.clj:478-482`) attributed to
the *new* lib, so the recorded failure blames the wrong spool. Observed on the live canonical weaver: deleting the
vendored `skein.spools/kanban` root bricked `reload!`; the subsequent `codethread/kanban` sync — a genuinely-new
coordinate, so it re-resolved — failed with an error citing the deleted `skein.spools/kanban` path. The remedy —
recreate a stub directory at the deleted path so canonicalization succeeds until the next restart clears
`the-basis` — had to be reverse-engineered from the stack trace.

**Why skein cannot already see this.** `reload!` (`runtime/alpha.clj:30-33`) → `reload-config!`
(`runtime.clj:273-303`) → `clear-reload-state!` (`runtime.clj:262-271`) resets skein's
`:approved-spool-sync-state` atom to `{}` on every reload, but does **not** touch tools.deps' `the-basis`. So after
a reload skein's own sync state is empty while the retained universe is intact: the deleted-root fact lives only in
`(:libs (clojure.java.basis/current-basis))`, which `sync!` never inspects before calling `add-libs`. The existing
per-entry existence check (`spool_sync.clj:454`, `(not (.exists root-file))` → `:missing-root`) guards only the
root of the entry *being synced*, never the retained universe that poisons the `add-libs` call.

This retention hazard is already known in-repo: `test/skein/runtime_deps_test.clj` carries `keep-add-libs-root!`
whose comment states "tools.deps keeps add-libs local roots in JVM-global basis state. Retaining temp spool roots
prevents later add-libs calls in this shard from failing while canonicalizing an earlier, now-deleted local/root
coordinate." The test works *around* the hazard; this feature makes it a diagnosable failure.

## PROP-srr-001.P2 Goals

- **PROP-srr-001.G1:** A preflight in `sync-approved-spools` that, before any `add-libs` runs, detects
  session-retained `:local/root` libs whose path is missing from disk and has left the approved allowlist.
- **PROP-srr-001.G2 (fail loudly, TEN-003):** On detection, throw an `ex-info` whose message and data name (a) the
  retained lib coordinate, (b) the deleted path, and (c) both remedies — stub directory (until next restart) or
  weaver restart — so the operator gets the failing value and the allowed alternatives without reading a stack
  trace.
- **PROP-srr-001.G3 (TEN-004, minimal surface):** One preflight, one failure. No new sync-state field, no new
  config key, no change to `add-libs` call sites, `use!`, the classloader, or the per-entry `:missing-root` path.
- **PROP-srr-001.G4:** Healthy syncs — every retained root still present on disk — behave exactly as today.

## PROP-srr-001.P3 Non-goals

- **PROP-srr-001.NG1 — no classloader / retained-universe redesign.** The root cause is that `add-libs`
  re-canonicalizes the whole retained `:libs` on every re-resolving add and never evicts a `:local/root`. Fixing that
  (an isolated spool classloader that skein controls, or per-sync basis scoping) is the "own the spool classpath"
  refinement card's, not this one (brief "Deliberately not built").
- **PROP-srr-001.NG2 — no auto-repair.** The preflight does not create the stub directory, prune the retained
  basis, or restart the weaver. Per TEN-003 it names the failing value and the allowed remedies and stops; the
  operator chooses.
- **PROP-srr-001.NG3 — no change to healthy-root behavior or to the per-entry `:missing-root` result**
  (`spool_sync.clj:454`). The per-entry check guards the entry being synced; the preflight is disjoint — it flags
  only retained roots that have *left* the allowlist, so a still-approved deleted root is left entirely to the
  per-entry `:missing-root` path. Neither absorbs the other.
- **PROP-srr-001.NG4 — no eviction of the retained basis.** This feature reads `the-basis`; it never mutates it.
  Mutating a process-global tools.deps atom to "unretain" a root is exactly the redesign NG1 defers.

## PROP-srr-001.P4 Proposed scope

- **PROP-srr-001.S1 — retained-root preflight.** At the top of `sync-approved-spools` (`spool_sync.clj:484-493`),
  once per sync and before any `add-libs` (`spool_sync.clj:466-471`), scan the session-retained universe —
  `(:libs (clojure.java.basis/current-basis))`, the same accessor `add-libs` reads (`clojure/repl/deps.clj:41`), which
  `current-basis` (`clojure/java/basis.clj:43-47`) derefs from the process-global `the-basis`. Flag every `:libs`
  entry that (a) carries a `:local/root`, (b) whose `io/file` no longer `.exists`, **and** (c) is not in the current
  approved allowlist. Maven-resolved deps carry no `:local/root` and are out of scope. Excluding still-approved roots
  is deliberate: a deleted root that is still in `spools.edn` is left to the per-entry `:missing-root` check
  (`spool_sync.clj:454`), so the preflight catches exactly the roots that have left the allowlist and would poison the
  next re-resolving `add-libs` for an unrelated spool — the `skein.spools/kanban`→`codethread/kanban` case that
  bricked the live weaver. When the basis is nil/empty (process not launched by the CLI) there are no retained local
  roots and the preflight is a no-op (G4). No dependency is added: `clojure.java.basis` and `clojure.repl.deps` are
  already on the runtime classpath.
- **PROP-srr-001.S2 — loud failure (TEN-003).** On finding one or more retained-but-deleted roots the preflight
  throws an `ex-info` before the map, giving the operator the failing value and the allowed alternatives:
  - **Message:** states a session-retained spool root was deleted from disk and that `sync!` cannot proceed because
    tools.deps will re-canonicalize the retained root on the next re-resolving `add-libs`; names the retained lib and
    the deleted path in prose so the stack-trace-free reader sees the cause.
  - **`ex-data`:** `:missing-roots` — a vector of `{:lib <retained lib symbol> :local/root <deleted path string>}`,
    one per missing root, so the operator gets all of them at once rather than failing, fixing one, and re-failing;
    `:remedy` — the allowed alternatives, named not applied (NG2): `:stub-dir` (recreate a bare directory at each
    deleted path — a bare directory suffices for canonicalization — effective until the next weaver restart clears the
    retained basis) and `:restart` (restart the weaver JVM, which discards `the-basis` and its retained roots; the
    durable fix when the root is gone for good and its lib has left the allowlist); `:retained-universe-source` — the
    accessor the operator or a future refinement can inspect, `clojure.java.basis/current-basis` `:libs`, so the
    diagnostic is self-describing.

  The exception propagates through `sync!` and, on the reload path, through `reload-config!` (`runtime.clj:282`)
  exactly like any other startup-file failure — `reload-config!` already leaves partially-loaded state in place and
  rethrows loudly (`runtime.clj:294-303`), so no reload-path change is needed. Unlike a `:runtime-add-failed` sync
  result (`spool_sync.clj:478-482`), the preflight failure is attributed to the actually-broken retained lib, not to
  whichever entry `add-libs` happened to be processing.
- **PROP-srr-001.S3 — cold focused tests.** Extend `test/skein/runtime_deps_test.clj` (which already owns
  add-libs-against-a-live-weaver coverage and documents this retention hazard in `keep-add-libs-root!`) to cover: a
  retained root that has left the allowlist and been deleted fails loudly with an `ex-info` whose `:missing-roots`
  names the lib and path and whose `:remedy` names `:stub-dir` and `:restart`; healthy retained roots are a no-op
  (G4); multiple missing roots are all reported; and the `:stub-dir` remedy unblocks a re-sync. Each case that deletes
  a retained root runs in an isolated worktree/temp world so the poisoned root does not leak into a sibling test
  shard's process-global basis, consistent with `keep-add-libs-root!`'s shard-isolation caution. Cold focused gate:
  `clojure -M:test skein.runtime-deps-test`. No Go, smoke, or api-docs surface changes.

## PROP-srr-001.P5 Open questions

Open questions: **None.** The alternatives below were weighed and resolved at authoring; they are recorded so the
plan author inherits the rationale.

- **PROP-srr-001.Q1 — preflight vs. wrapping the `add-libs` failure? (resolved: preflight, S1).** Catching the
  tools.deps canonicalization error inside `sync-approved-spool!` and rewriting it would still fire *after*
  `add-libs`, would depend on parsing tools.deps' error shape (brittle across versions), and would attribute the
  failure to whichever entry was mid-sync. **Adopted: a preflight that reads the same basis `add-libs` reads and fails
  first, naming the real culprit.**
- **PROP-srr-001.Q2 — read retained roots from skein's sync-state or tools.deps' basis? (resolved: the basis, S1).**
  Skein's `:approved-spool-sync-state` records `:root` per synced lib (`spool_sync.clj:155-160`), but
  `clear-reload-state!` (`runtime.clj:262-271`) empties it every reload while the retained universe survives — so
  sync-state is blind to exactly the cross-reload case that bricked the live weaver. **Adopted:
  `(:libs (clojure.java.basis/current-basis))`, the authoritative retained universe and the same value
  `resolve-added-libs` re-canonicalizes.**
- **PROP-srr-001.Q3 — fail the whole sync or record a per-lib sync result? (resolved: fail loudly, S2).** A soft
  `:failed` sync result (like `:runtime-add-failed`) would let the poisoned sync limp on, and the next re-resolving
  `add-libs` would still throw the misleading tools.deps error. A retained-but-deleted allowlist-orphan breaks the
  *whole* `add-libs` universe, not one entry, so degrading it to a per-entry status understates the blast radius.
  **Adopted: throw from `sync-approved-spools`, aborting the sync with a named cause and named remedies.**
- **PROP-srr-001.Q4 — auto-stub or prune the retained basis? (resolved: report only, NG2/NG4).** The preflight
  *could* `mkdir` the deleted path or `update-basis!` the stale lib out. Both are the redesign this card explicitly
  defers, and both mutate global/on-disk state on the operator's behalf without sign-off. **Adopted: name the remedy,
  do not apply it** — the stub-vs-restart choice is the operator's, and the durable fix is the refinement card's.
- **PROP-srr-001.Q5 — should the preflight also catch a still-approved root deleted from disk? (resolved: no,
  defer to per-entry, S1/NG3).** Narrowing the predicate to allowlist-orphans (S1) leaves a residual window: a root
  that is still approved but deleted, hit while an unrelated spool adds a genuinely-new coordinate, still surfaces the
  misleading tools.deps error rather than the preflight's. Widening the predicate to all missing retained roots would
  abort the whole sync in the far more common case where the deleted root is still approved and today completes via
  the soft `:missing-root` path — regressing G4/NG3. **Adopted: catch only allowlist-orphans now; the residual window
  closes fully only with the classloader redesign (NG1).**
