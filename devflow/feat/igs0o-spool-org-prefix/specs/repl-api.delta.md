# REPL API delta for igs0o-spool-org-prefix

**Document ID:** `DELTA-Sop-001`
**Root spec:** [repl-api.md](../../../specs/repl-api.md)
**Feature:** [../proposal.md](../proposal.md)
**Status:** Merged
**Last Updated:** 2026-07-15
**Configuration identification:** Document IDs must be ordered as document type, short name, sequential id, then optional version: `SPEC-Dwr-001` for v1 and `SPEC-Dwr-001@2` for v2. Omit `@1`; append `@2`, `@3`, etc. only when a new version supersedes an externally referenced document. Prefix every nested point ID with the full document ID, for example `DELTA-Sop-001.P1`, so references are globally grepable and do not clash across documents.

## DELTA-Sop-001.P1 Summary

SPEC-003.C19's contractual namespace tiers enumerate only `skein.*`
namespaces, all of which name source shipped by the skein checkout. External
shared spools live outside the checkout and already follow an org-prefix
source-namespace convention (`ct.spools.<name>` for codethread spools), but
no spec clause states it. This delta adds the rule to C19 without rewording
the existing tiers.

## DELTA-Sop-001.P2 Contract changes

- **DELTA-Sop-001.CC1:** Append to SPEC-003.C19: `skein.*` source namespaces
  are reserved for code shipped by the skein checkout; external/shared spool
  source namespaces use the author's org prefix instead (codethread spools
  use `ct.spools.<name>`), keeping them disjoint from every `skein.*` tier.

## DELTA-Sop-001.P3 Design decisions

### DELTA-Sop-001.D1 Additive sentence in C19 rather than a new clause

- **Decision:** The org-prefix rule rides in C19, the clause that already
  declares namespace tiers contractual.
- **Rationale:** The rule is the missing complement of the existing tier
  list — where source lives when it is *not* a `skein.*` tier. A separate
  clause would split one boundary across two IDs.
- **Rejected:** A new SPEC-003 clause; a standalone spools spec (the
  convention is a namespace-tier fact, and `docs/spools/writing-shared-spools.md`
  carries the authoring guidance).

## DELTA-Sop-001.P4 Open questions

- **DELTA-Sop-001.Q1:** None.
