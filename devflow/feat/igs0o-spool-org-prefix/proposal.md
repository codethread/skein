# Org-prefix convention for external spool source namespaces Proposal

**Document ID:** `PROP-Sop-001`
**Last Updated:** 2026-07-15
**Related RFCs:** None
**Related root specs:** [SPEC-003](../../specs/repl-api.md) (C19 namespace tiers)

## PROP-Sop-001.P1 Problem

`docs/spools/writing-shared-spools.md` documents a project-prefix convention
for vocab claims (the "Namespace claims" section) but says nothing about Clojure
*source* namespaces. Epic xl7ph moved every codethread external spool to
`ct.spools.*`, so the convention is live in the index (`spools/README.md`)
and in shipped spools, but the rule itself is written down nowhere: the two
authoritative tier statements — SPEC-003.C19 and the doc's "Namespace tiers
(why this split exists)" section — enumerate only `skein.*` tiers. A new
external-spool author has no stated rule for naming their source namespaces,
and `skein.*`'s lives-in-the-skein-checkout meaning is only implied.

## PROP-Sop-001.P2 Goals

- **PROP-Sop-001.G1:** The org-prefix rule for external/shared spool source
  namespaces (`ct.spools.<name>` for codethread; org prefix generally) is
  stated in `docs/spools/writing-shared-spools.md` where tier/namespace
  guidance already lives.
- **PROP-Sop-001.G2:** The complementary meaning of `skein.*` — source that
  lives in the skein checkout, per the SPEC-003.C19 tiers — is stated
  alongside it.
- **PROP-Sop-001.G3:** SPEC-003.C19 carries the contractual form of the rule
  (namespace tiers are contractual per repo convention), as an additive
  sentence — no rewording of existing tiers.
- **PROP-Sop-001.G4:** The three naming axes stay clearly distinct for the
  reader: source namespace (`ct.spools.*` vs `skein.*`), vocab/attribute
  namespace prefix (`acme/priority`, existing "Namespace claims" rule), and
  the `spools.edn` coordinate symbol (`codethread/<name>`).

## PROP-Sop-001.P3 Non-goals

- **PROP-Sop-001.NG1:** No renaming or moving of any code; every spool
  already follows the convention.
- **PROP-Sop-001.NG2:** No change to the vocab-claims prefix rule or the
  registry duplicate-owner check.
- **PROP-Sop-001.NG3:** No change to coordinate-symbol conventions in
  `.skein/spools.edn`.

## PROP-Sop-001.P4 Proposed scope

- **PROP-Sop-001.S1:** Extend the "Namespace tiers (why this split exists)"
  section of `docs/spools/writing-shared-spools.md` with the external-spool
  source-namespace rule and the lives-in-checkout meaning of `skein.*`.
- **PROP-Sop-001.S2:** Add a short cross-reference so the "Namespace claims"
  section cannot be misread as covering source namespaces.
- **PROP-Sop-001.S3:** Add an additive sentence to SPEC-003.C19 stating that
  external/shared spool source is namespaced under an org prefix rather than
  `skein.*`.

## PROP-Sop-001.P5 Open questions

- **PROP-Sop-001.Q1:** None.
