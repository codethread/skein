# Workflow Authoring Ergonomics

**Document ID:** `RFC-012`
**Status:** Implemented
**Date:** 2026-07-02
**Related:** [Workflow spool](../../src/skein/spools/workflow.md) (§3 loops, §4 run lifecycle, §5 routing), [Devflow spool](../../src/skein/spools/devflow.md), [afk-gates feature](../feat/afk-gates/proposal.md), [RFC-011](./2026-07-02-coordination-attention-surface.md)

## RFC-012.P1 Problem

Building three treadle-era features on 2026-07-02 exercised the workflow
engine as both a library consumer (devflow's new delegated AFK stage) and a
direct driver (two hand-poured coordination workflows). The engine's
semantics held up without modification — the gaps are all *authoring
ergonomics*: things every author re-derives, re-types, or hand-rolls.

- **RFC-012.P1.1: Sequential pipelines over data cannot be expressed with
  `:loop`.** The delegated AFK stage needed "one gate per approved task,
  each depending on the previous". `:loop {:each …}` expands copies with
  **no way to express dependencies between items**, so
  `devflow/run-afk-loop-workflow` hand-rolls the chain:

  ```clojure
  (loop [remaining tasks previous nil steps []]
    (if-let [task (first remaining)]
      (let [id (afk-task-step-id task)]
        (recur (rest remaining) id
               (conj steps (afk-task-gate task previous …))))
      steps))
  ```

  This is the exact shape `:loop` exists to remove, and any future pipeline
  author (RFC-013's `delegate-pipeline` pattern, a build/deploy chain, a
  multi-round review) will write the same loop again. Fan-*out* is free in
  the engine; fan-*through* is not.

- **RFC-012.P1.2: `start!`'s durability opts are boilerplate with a delayed
  failure mode.** A revisable run must be started as:

  ```clojure
  (workflow/start! "run-x" (my/flow params) params
                   {:definition 'my.ns/flow :context params-as-strings})
  ```

  Three of the four arguments repeat the same information. Forgetting
  `:definition` is silent at start and **fails only when a `:revise` choice
  is taken**, far from the mistake (workflow.md §5 documents the constraint
  but cannot enforce it early). Both live demos in the session had to get
  this incantation right by hand; devflow wraps it away for its own stages
  but every ad-hoc workflow author faces it raw.

- **RFC-012.P1.3: Frontier selection is a re-typed filter.** The coordinator
  and the treadle both constantly need "the ready subagent gates" or "the
  ready checkpoint". The session transcript and the new test files contain
  at least six copies of:

  ```clojure
  (first (filter #(= "subagent" (:gate %)) (workflow/next-steps run-id)))
  ```

  `next-step` throws on any parallelism, so authors fall back to this. The
  step views already carry everything needed (`:gate`, `:kind`,
  `:checkpoint`); only the selector is missing.

- **RFC-012.P1.4: Registration and definition are separate, drift-prone
  acts.** A routable/revisable workflow needs (a) a constructor fn, (b)
  `register-workflow!` under a stable name, (c) callers seeding
  `:definition` with the constructor's fully-qualified symbol. devflow keeps
  these consistent via its own `stage-workflows` map + `register-workflows!`;
  every other author maintains the triple by hand, and a rename breaks
  in-flight runs (workflow.md §5's durability warning) precisely because the
  symbol is spelled in multiple places.

## RFC-012.P2 Goals

- **RFC-012.G1:** Express "pipeline over a param vector" declaratively —
  chain semantics inside `:loop`, composing with existing render env,
  conditions, splicing, and base-id fan-in.
- **RFC-012.G2:** Make the *correct* (revisable, routable) way to start a
  run also the *shortest* way; surface the missing-definition mistake at
  start time, not revise time.
- **RFC-012.G3:** Frontier selectors for the two step kinds that drive all
  coordination decisions (gates, checkpoints) without widening the
  `next-steps` contract.
- **RFC-012.G4:** Keep everything data-first (TEN-001): no DSL growth beyond
  one loop key; macros only where they remove a real consistency hazard, not
  for syntax pleasure.

## RFC-012.P3 Non-goals

- **RFC-012.NG1:** No changes to run semantics — done-ness, routing
  transactions, revision loops, and gate close rules are settled and tested;
  this RFC is additive surface only.
- **RFC-012.NG2:** No per-item dependency *graphs* inside loops (arbitrary
  DAGs per item). Chains cover the observed need; full graphs are what
  explicit steps are for.
- **RFC-012.NG3:** No template/proto storage layer; a definition remains a
  Clojure fn (workflow.md §2's deliberate divergence from beads).

## RFC-012.P4 Current state (for grounding)

- Loop expansion (workflow.clj, `:loop` handling): runs after param
  resolution; renders each copy's `:title`/`:description`/`:attributes`
  against `(merge params {:item … :i …})`; rewrites other steps'
  `:depends-on` on the **base id** to all expanded ids. A `:condition` on a
  loop step is evaluated against the **workflow params only** (`:item`/`:i`
  are not in scope for conditions), so its outcome is uniform: exclusion
  drops *all* copies together, and splicing reattaches dependents. There is
  no per-item filtering today.
- `start!` signature: `(start! run-id workflow params opts)`; opts
  `:definition`/`:context`/`:family`/`:root-attributes`. `:revise` reads
  `workflow/definition` from the root and fails loudly when absent — but
  only then.
- `register-workflow!` registry is weaver-lifetime in-memory, re-registered
  from startup config; `:next` keywords resolve through it at `choose!`
  time.
- `next-steps` returns views carrying `:gate` (waiter string), `:kind`,
  `:checkpoint`, `:choices`; `next-step` throws when >1 ready.

## RFC-012.P5 Options

| ID | Summary | Pros | Cons |
| -- | ------- | ---- | ---- |
| RFC-012.O1 | Status quo; authors hand-roll chains and boilerplate. | No engine change. | The hand-rolled chain already shipped once (devflow) and RFC-013 would ship it a second time; `start!` misuse keeps failing late. |
| RFC-012.O2 | `:loop {:chain true}`: expansion i depends on expansion i-1; first item keeps the step's declared `:depends-on`. | One boolean key; reuses all existing loop machinery (render env, suffixing, base-id fan-in). | Interaction rules (fan-in meaning; how future per-item conditions would re-link a broken chain) must be specified precisely. |
| RFC-012.O3 | `start!` accepts a **var or registered keyword** as the workflow argument: `(start! "run-x" #'my/flow params)` — constructor invoked with params, `:definition` derived from the var/registry, `:context` defaulted from params. | Removes the triple repetition; missing-definition becomes impossible on this path; map-form `start!` stays for pre-built data. | Context defaulting needs a JSON-safety rule (see Q2); two call shapes to document. |
| RFC-012.O4 | Frontier selectors: `(next-gates run-id)` / `(next-gates run-id waiter)` / `(next-checkpoint run-id)` returning views / nil / throwing only where genuinely ambiguous. | Tiny, pure; deletes the repeated filter. | Three more public fns (TEN-004 tax). |
| RFC-012.O5 | `defworkflow` macro: defines the constructor, registers it under a stable keyword, stamps metadata `start!` can read. | Single point of truth for the fn/name/symbol triple; renames stop breaking routes because the registered name is adjacent to the defn. | It's a macro in a deliberately data-first codebase; registration-at-load has ordering implications (namespace load vs weaver install); O3 already removes most of the pain. |
| RFC-012.O6 | Full builder DSL rework (steps as threading macros etc.). | — | Rejected outright: the data builders are the product's character (TEN-001). |

## RFC-012.P6 Recommendation

- **RFC-012.REC1:** Adopt **O2 (`:chain true`)** with these exact semantics:
  - expansion *i* gets `:depends-on [expansion-(i-1)]`; expansion 0 keeps
    the step's own declared `:depends-on`;
  - a step depending on the **base id** still depends on **all** expansions
    (unchanged fan-in — with a chain that is semantically "the last one",
    and keeping the existing rule means zero special cases);
  - a `:condition` on a chained loop step stays params-only and uniform:
    it drops the whole chain (with splicing reattaching dependents), never a
    middle link — per-item conditions do not exist today and are **out of
    scope** here; if ever added, chain re-linking through excluded middle
    items becomes their acceptance test (see Q5);
  - `:chain true` with `:count` works identically (items 1..n).
  Then rewrite `devflow`'s hand-rolled AFK chain on top of it, as the
  proving consumer.
- **RFC-012.REC2:** Adopt **O3**: `start!` (and `describe`) accept a var or
  registered keyword; derive `:definition` (var → symbol; keyword → registry
  lookup, failing loudly on unknown names *at start time*); default
  `:context` to the params map when absent. Document map-form `start!` as
  the "pre-compiled data" escape hatch it already is.
- **RFC-012.REC3:** Adopt **O4** as exactly three fns (`next-gates`,
  `next-checkpoint`, and a general `(next-steps run-id {:kind …:gate …})`
  filter arity — pick during implementation whichever keeps the surface
  smallest, but ship the capability).
- **RFC-012.REC4:** **Defer O5 (`defworkflow`)**. Re-evaluate only if, after
  REC2, authors still misregister workflows in practice. A macro should earn
  its place by preventing observed mistakes, and REC2 removes the observed
  one.
- **RFC-012.REC5:** Every addition updates workflow.md (§3 loops table, §4
  lifecycle, §5 registry) and `explain` — the machine-readable contract must
  not lag the doc (TEN-001).

## RFC-012.P7 Likely user-facing shape

```clojure
;; a delegated pipeline, declaratively:
(workflow/workflow
  "Ship tasks"
  {:params {:feature (workflow/param :required true)
            :tasks   (workflow/param :required true)}}
  (workflow/gate :task
                 (fn [{:keys [item feature]}] (str (:title item) " for " feature))
                 :subagent
                 :loop {:each :tasks :chain true}
                 :attributes {"shuttle/harness" (fn [{:keys [item]}] (:harness item))
                              "shuttle/prompt"  (fn [{:keys [item]}] (:body item))})
  (workflow/checkpoint :accept "Accept results" :depends-on [:task] ...))

;; starting it, revisable by construction:
(workflow/start! "feat-x" #'my.flows/ship-tasks {:feature "x" :tasks [...]})

;; coordination reads:
(workflow/next-gates "feat-x" "subagent")
(workflow/next-checkpoint "feat-x")
```

## RFC-012.P8 Open questions

- **RFC-012.Q1:** With `:chain true`, should the *base-id* fan-in rule be
  narrowed to "depends on the last expansion" instead of "all"? All-of is
  redundant-but-harmless for chains and keeps one rule for both loop modes;
  last-of is minimal but forks the semantics. Recommendation leans all-of.
- **RFC-012.Q2:** `start!` context defaulting: `workflow/context` must be
  JSON-safe and today devflow stringifies keyword values before seeding.
  Should REC2 coerce (stringify keywords, reject fns loudly) or require the
  caller to pass explicit `:context` when params aren't JSON-safe? Loud
  rejection is the TEN-003-consistent answer.
- **RFC-012.Q3:** Should a var-started run persist enough to survive the var
  being moved (i.e. auto-register under a derived keyword)? Probably no —
  the registry exists precisely to make that an explicit, named decision.
- **RFC-012.Q4:** Does `describe` need `:chain` surfaced per expanded step,
  or is the materialized `:depends-on` (which it already shows) sufficient?
- **RFC-012.Q5:** Are per-item loop conditions (`:condition` seeing
  `:item`/`:i`) wanted at all? Nothing in the session needed them; they are
  noted only because `:chain` semantics must be re-specified (middle-link
  splicing) if they ever land.

## RFC-012.P9 Outcome

- **RFC-012.OUT1:** Open for review. If accepted: REC1 first (it deletes
  shipped duplication in devflow and unblocks RFC-013's pattern), then REC2
  and REC3 together (both are small, test-heavy, and independent), REC4
  deferred by default.
- **RFC-012.OUT2 (2026-07-02):** Accepted and implemented via the delegated
  pipeline (implement → review → fix, all shuttle runs). REC1/REC2/REC3/REC5
  shipped: `:loop {:chain true}` (all-of fan-in kept per Q1), var/keyword
  `start!`/`describe` with loud unknown-keyword and non-JSON-safe-context
  failures (Q2 answered: keyword values coerced, non-finite numbers and fns
  rejected), `next-gates`/`next-checkpoint`/filtered `next-steps`, doc and
  `explain` parity, and devflow's AFK chain rewritten on chain loops. REC4
  (`defworkflow`) remains deferred.
