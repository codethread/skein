# Task 1: Accretive fractal mechanism + applied spool op (design slice)

**Document ID:** `TASK-Lhc-001`

## TASK-Lhc-001.P1 Scope

Type: AFK

Implement the arity-N fractal subcommand mechanism and per-leaf class support
**accretively** (new shape accepted and preferred; existing op-level classes and
defaults still tolerated — the flip is Task 5), and apply it end-to-end to one
op: batteries `spool` folds `spool-status` in as its `status` read leaf. This is
the design-authority slice: DELTA-Lhc-001/002/003 are the binding contract, and
you may amend a delta only with concrete evidence from this seam (note any
amendment in the plan's Developer Notes).

## TASK-Lhc-001.P2 Must implement exactly

- **TASK-Lhc-001.MI1:** Recursive arg-spec structural validation per
  DELTA-Lhc-001.CC1: leaf = node without `:subcommands` (doc-only leaves valid),
  interior nodes may not carry `:flags`/`:positionals`, empty `:subcommands {}`
  invalid, reserved names rejected at every level. Node-level `:hook-class`/
  `:deadline-class` accepted on leaves per DELTA-Lhc-001.CC2 and **rejected on
  interior nodes** (that rejection is already assertive); absence is tolerated
  in this slice.
- **TASK-Lhc-001.MI2:** Recursive parse routing per DELTA-Lhc-001.CC3:
  `:subcommand` is always the full path **vector**; canonical error context
  (`:op`, `:path`, `:token`, `:available`) on missing/unknown tokens; payload
  refs and `:parse` work at every depth. `explain` renders nested subcommands
  recursively.
- **TASK-Lhc-001.MI3:** Returns mirror-recursion per DELTA-Lhc-001.CC4 in
  `skein.api.return-shape.alpha` and the op-entry alignment checks; `check!`/
  `check-op-return!` take path contexts (DELTA-Lhc-001.CC7).
- **TASK-Lhc-001.MI4:** Leaf resolution at the socket per DELTA-Lhc-002.CC3/CC4,
  accretive: walk argv to the leaf; use leaf classes when declared, else fall
  back to the op-entry classes (current behavior). Missing/unknown verb of a
  subcommand op fails loudly pre-hook with the canonical context. Deadline
  default from the leaf when declared (envelope timeout still wins).
- **TASK-Lhc-001.MI5:** Help projection per DELTA-Lhc-003.CC1/CC2 and
  DELTA-Lhc-001.CC5/CC6: node keys `hook-class`/`deadline-class` (leaf values —
  from node metadata or, this slice only, the op-entry fallback; `null` on
  interior/subcommand-root nodes), envelope `operation` drops both keys,
  `schema-version` bumps, verb-path slicing to any depth and to interior nodes,
  catalog rule per DELTA-Lhc-003.CC1. Trailing `--help` rewrite composes with
  deep paths per DELTA-Lhc-002.CC6. Update the batteries reference help
  transform for the new envelope/node shape.
- **TASK-Lhc-001.MI6:** Dispatch label from the path vector joined with spaces
  (SPEC-004.C63b amendment in DELTA-Lhc-002.CC5); keep the `:action` amendment
  working until Task 5 removes it. Recursive annotation/glossary collection per
  DELTA-Lhc-001.CC5 for the direct registration route.
- **TASK-Lhc-001.MI7:** Applied op: batteries `spool` gains `status` (read leaf,
  offline contract verbatim per DELTA-Lhc-001.CC8); `spool-status` op removed;
  all `spool` leaves declare both classes in the arg-spec. Its returns tree,
  tests, and the smoke references to `spool-status` update with it.
- **TASK-Lhc-001.MI8:** Synthetic depth-3 grammar fixture in the test tier
  proving: composition from flat `def`ed node blocks, parse path vectors, per
  leaf classes, deep help slicing, deep returns routing, deep glossary refs.

## TASK-Lhc-001.P3 Done when

- **TASK-Lhc-001.DW1:** Cold `clojure -M:test` green on the owned/extended test
  namespaces: cli parser/validation, return-shape, op-entry/registry, weaver
  help, socket integration (pre-hook verb failures; read-leaf hook skipping;
  leaf deadline), batteries owner tests, test/alpha.
- **TASK-Lhc-001.DW2:** `clojure -M:smoke` and `(cd cli && go test ./...)`
  green; `make api-docs` re-run when docstrings changed (regenerated files
  committed); `make fmt-check lint reflect-check docs-check` green; clean
  `git status --short`.
- **TASK-Lhc-001.DW3:** Any delta amendments recorded in the delta file(s) and
  the plan's Developer Notes.

## TASK-Lhc-001.P4 Out of scope

- **TASK-Lhc-001.OS1:** Enforcement (mandatory classes, forbidding op-level
  classes beside an arg-spec, publication-seam strictness) — Task 5.
- **TASK-Lhc-001.OS2:** Sweeping any registrant other than the `spool` op —
  Tasks 2–4. Do not touch `.skein/`, guild, text-search, workflow/chime/cron,
  or batteries ops other than `spool`/`spool-status` (renderer excepted per
  MI5).
- **TASK-Lhc-001.OS3:** Root spec promotion and prose docs — Task 6.

## TASK-Lhc-001.P5 File ownership (exclusive only while Task 1 is open)

Ownership transfers when Task 1 closes: Task 2 then owns the batteries op
definitions + owner tests, Task 3 the `register-built-in-ops!` declaration
block, Task 4 the fixtures it names. The smoke suite is Task 1-owned (this
slice changes the envelope and the `spool` surface) and stays green here.

(spool op + renderer regions), and their co-located test namespaces.
