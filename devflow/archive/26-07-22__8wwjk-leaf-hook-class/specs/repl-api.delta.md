# repl-api delta for 8wwjk-leaf-hook-class

**Document ID:** `DELTA-Lhc-001`
**Root spec:** [repl-api.md](../../../specs/repl-api.md)
**Feature:** [../proposal.md](../proposal.md)
**Status:** Merged
**Last Updated:** 2026-07-22

## DELTA-Lhc-001.P1 Summary

Subcommand arg-specs nest to arbitrary depth with one uniform fractal node shape,
and `:hook-class`/`:deadline-class` become mandatory leaf-node metadata declared in
the arg-spec, replacing the op-wide classes. Breaking under TEN-000@1; loud at
registration under TEN-003.

## DELTA-Lhc-001.P2 Contract changes

- **DELTA-Lhc-001.CC1 (supersedes SPEC-003.C64 one-level cap):** An arg-spec node
  declaring `:subcommands` maps subcommand names to nested nodes of the **same
  shape**, at any depth. A **leaf** is any node that does not declare
  `:subcommands`; its `:flags`/`:positionals` are optional (a doc-only leaf is
  valid — `query list`, `spool about`). A node declaring `:subcommands` is an
  **interior** node and may not also declare `:flags`/`:positionals`; an empty
  `:subcommands {}` is invalid (every op must reach at least one invocable leaf).
  The shared structural validator enforces these rules recursively, and reserved
  names (`help`, `-h`, `--help`, the `subcommand` arg name) are rejected at
  **every** level.
- **DELTA-Lhc-001.CC2 (leaf classes; amends SPEC-003.C64):** Every leaf node of
  an op **that declares an arg-spec** carries mandatory `:hook-class`
  (`:read`|`:mutating`) and `:deadline-class` (`:standard`|`:unbounded`) node
  metadata, peers of `:doc`/`:flags`/`:positionals`/`:annotations` — a flat op's
  arg-spec root **is** its leaf, so flat classes are authored there, never in
  registration opts. A **raw-envelope** op (no arg-spec) is the one shape whose
  classes live in registration metadata (DELTA-Lhc-002.CC1) — there is no other
  place to put them. Interior nodes may not declare either (loud structural
  failure): interior nodes are never invocable, so a class there is dead
  metadata. A leaf of a stream-class op must declare
  `:deadline-class :unbounded` — streams stay explicitly unbounded and no
  streaming-timeout machinery is introduced.
- **DELTA-Lhc-001.CC3 (amends SPEC-003.C65 routing):** Parsing a subcommand
  arg-spec routes on the first argv token **recursively**: each token selects a
  child node until a leaf is reached, and the remaining argv parses against the
  leaf. The parsed map merges the leaf result with `:subcommand` bound to the
  **full path as a vector of name strings** (e.g. `["task" "add"]`), always a
  vector at every depth. Missing or unknown tokens at any level throw loud
  structured errors carrying the op name, the node path walked so far, the
  offending token (or its absence), and the available child names. Payload
  references and `:parse` declarations apply unchanged inside every nested level.
  Path-carrying errors across **all** seams (structural validation, parsing, the
  socket pre-hook walk, help slicing, return selection) use one canonical
  context shape: `:op` (string), `:path` (vector of tokens successfully walked,
  `[]` at the root), `:token` (the offending token, or `nil` when a token is
  missing), and `:available` (vector of child names at the failing node).
- **DELTA-Lhc-001.CC4 (amends SPEC-003.C60b returns routing):** When a subcommand
  op declares `:returns` (declaring returns stays optional, as today), it mirrors
  the arg-spec tree: an interior return node is
  `{:subcommands {<name> <return-node> ...}}` and a leaf return node is a return
  case, with names matching the arg-spec **exactly at every level**. The
  return-shape validator, `explain`, and `check!` recurse accordingly; `check!`'s
  selection context takes the full subcommand path.
- **DELTA-Lhc-001.CC5 (amends SPEC-003.C66/C67 projection):** `hook-class` and
  `deadline-class` leave the envelope's op-wide facts and become **node keys**
  with defined semantics for every node kind: populated on invocable leaf nodes
  (a flat or raw-envelope op's root node **is** its leaf), `null` on interior
  nodes and on subcommand-op roots. Catalog summary nodes follow the same rule
  (populated only when the summary node is itself the leaf). Per-node closed
  `:annotations` sub-maps are honored at every depth, and the unconditional
  glossary-ref existence check walks **all** depths — a deep `failure-modes`
  name must not evade validation on **either** registration route: direct
  `register-op!`/`replace-op!` checks against the live glossary as today, and
  module publication checks each generation's entries after that generation's
  glossary contributions merge, failing the reconcile loudly before the
  generation becomes effective (the C67 load-order contract applied to
  publication, atomic per generation).
- **DELTA-Lhc-001.CC6 (rewrites SPEC-003.C68):** Help paths are live to the
  arg-spec's declared depth: `strand help <op> <verb> [<verb> ...]` slices the
  envelope to **any** node the token path names — interior nodes are valid help
  targets and return their slice with `children` — failing loudly with the
  canonical CC3 error context on a token that names no child. Arbitrary-depth
  recursion is now proven by live ops, not only the synthetic renderer test.
- **DELTA-Lhc-001.CC7 (amends SPEC-003.C28):** `check-op-return!`'s subcommand
  context is the full path (vector), aligned with CC3/CC4.
- **DELTA-Lhc-001.CC8 (amends SPEC-003.C63a/C63b):** The batteries spool surface
  folds `spool-status` into the `spool` op as its `status` read leaf: `spool
  status` keeps the offline, no-network, closed-result contract verbatim, and
  the separate `spool-status` op is retired (TEN-000@1, no alias). C63b's
  `spool-status` validation sentence applies to `spool status`. The batteries
  behavior contract (`spools/batteries.md`) and spool index sweep with it.

## DELTA-Lhc-001.P3 Design decisions

### DELTA-Lhc-001.D1 Path values are vectors, never joined strings

- **Decision:** `:subcommand`, error-context paths, and `check-op-return!`
  contexts carry the path as a vector of name strings at every depth.
- **Rationale:** TEN-001 — raw structured data over display strings; consumers
  join for display (the dispatch label joins with spaces per SPEC-004.C63b).
- **Rejected:** Joined strings (lossy split on names containing spaces is
  impossible to rule out structurally); scalar-at-depth-1 with vectors deeper
  (two shapes for one concept).

### DELTA-Lhc-001.D2 Leaf-only, mandatory, no derivation

- **Decision:** Classes exist only on leaves; nothing is derived onto interior
  nodes, op roots, or the envelope.
- **Rationale:** Nothing invocable resolves to a non-leaf, so any non-leaf class
  is either dead metadata or a silently-wrong summary; mandatory declaration
  forces the read/write audit the old default let registrants skip (TEN-003).
- **Rejected:** Op-level fallback with leaf override (decision note mnl04 —
  superseded: keeps the misclassification hazard); derived op-wide superclass
  (compat crutch for consumers we own and are sweeping anyway).

## DELTA-Lhc-001.P4 Open questions

- None. (The path-shape question from PROP-Lhc-001.Q1 is settled by D1; the
  design thin-slice may reopen it only with evidence from the applied seam.)
