# Task 001: Reed executor spool + full tested contract

**Document ID:** `TASK-ShellGates-001` **Feature:** `workflow-shell-gates` (branch `workflow-shell-gates`, worktree `/Users/ct/dev/projects/skein-src__workflow-shell-gates`) **Plan:** `PLAN-ShellGates-001` — this task is `PLAN-ShellGates-001.PH1`.

## P1 Scope

Type: AFK

Ship the classpath executor spool `skein.spools.reed` and its full behaviour contract test. The spool fulfils workflow gates whose waiter is `:shell` by running the gate's `shell/argv` directly off the weaver event thread, closes the gate on a zero exit through `skein.spools.workflow/complete!`, and stamps a loud, distinct `shell/error` on any failure. It is a treadle sibling minus everything shuttle-specific (`PLAN-ShellGates-001.P2`, `.P8` "What is shuttle-specific"). This task is code + tests only — **no** docs, indexes, or repo activation.

Reference implementation to mirror: `spools/shuttle/src/skein/spools/treadle.clj` (event handler, `scan!`, idempotent claim, `complete!`-on-success, `gate-stalled?`, `register-executor!`, `register-query!`, runtime-owned versioned `spool-state`, scan monitor). Rationale for every decision below is in the plan sections cited — do not re-derive design here.

## P2 Must implement exactly

- **MI1 — new file `spools/src/skein/spools/reed.clj`, ns `skein.spools.reed`**
  with a namespace docstring (implementation-boundary rule: every ns gets a
  docstring). Classpath tier, sibling of `loom`/`workflow` — **not** an approved
  local root (`PLAN-ShellGates-001.D1`). Requires the workflow surface, the
  weaver/current/runtime alpha APIs, and `skein.spools.util` (`fail!`,
  `attr-get`), mirroring treadle's require set; it must **not** require
  `skein.spools.shuttle` or any `shuttle/*` vocabulary.

- **MI2 — event-driven scan (`PLAN-ShellGates-001.A1`).** Define
  `event-types` `#{:strand/added :strand/updated :batch/applied :strand/burned
  :strand/superseded}` (matching treadle). `install!` registers one event
  handler (key `:reed/engine`, symbol `'skein.spools.reed/on-event`,
  `{:spool "reed"}`) whose `on-event` runs `scan!`, and runs one initial scan at
  the end of `install!` (treadle precedent). `scan!` enumerates ready `:shell`
  gates purely through the workflow surface — `(workflow/active-runs)` →
  `(workflow/next-steps run-id)` filtered to `(= "shell" (:gate step))` — and
  never reaches into engine internals. `scan!` serializes on a runtime-owned
  monitor (`locking (scan-monitor)`).

- **MI3 — runtime-owned versioned state (`PLAN-ShellGates-001.A2`).** All state
  under `skein.api.runtime.alpha/spool-state` keyed by the spool — **no
  module-level atoms**. `new-state` returns a map holding the scan monitor
  (`(Object.)`) **and** a spool-owned worker `java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService`
  on which processes actually run (create it lazily in `new-state`). Define
  `state-version` (start at `1`) and pass it as `{:version state-version}` to
  `spool-state`; add a `state-shape-matches-declared-version` test (MI11) that
  asserts `new-state`'s key set, exactly as treadle's. Register a runtime-stop
  hook that shuts the worker pool down (mirror the shuttle scheduler lifecycle —
  inspect how `skein.spools.shuttle` registers its stop hook) so the pool never
  outlives the world and no child process is orphaned (`PLAN-ShellGates-001.R4`).

- **MI4 — process execution OFF the event thread (`PLAN-ShellGates-001.A3`,
  `.R1`).** When `scan!` finds a ready, un-claimed, un-errored `:shell` gate it
  **claims** it idempotently by stamping a `shell/running` marker **before**
  dispatch, then submits the actual `ProcessBuilder` execution to the worker
  pool. The event thread NEVER calls `.waitFor` or blocks on a child process —
  only the worker thread does. On completion the worker thread stamps the outcome
  and, on a zero exit, calls `workflow/complete!`. Use an async `*runtime*`
  dynamic + `rt` helper (treadle idiom) so worker threads resolve the runtime.

- **MI5 — `shell/*` gate attribute contract (`PLAN-ShellGates-001.A4`).** All
  plain JSON `TEXT` read tolerantly via `attr-get`:
  - `shell/argv` (input, **required**): JSON array of strings, executed directly
    with **no** implicit shell. Missing / blank / non-array / non-string-element
    fails loudly onto `shell/error`, spawning no process (`NG4`, TEN-003).
  - `shell/cwd` (input, optional): process working directory; absent → the
    weaver's default working directory.
  - `shell/timeout-secs` (input, optional): wall-clock bound; on expiry the
    process is killed (`destroyForcibly`) and `shell/error` stamped. A
    non-positive / non-integer value fails loudly onto `shell/error` — do **not**
    silently clamp (TEN-003).
  - `shell/exit-code` (recorded): process exit code, recorded on **both** pass
    and fail; absent when no process ran (invalid argv / spawn error).
  - `shell/output` (recorded): bounded stdout+stderr **tail** (last N KB, one
    fixed bound). Read the child's stdout/stderr into a bounded ring so a runaway
    process cannot exhaust weaver heap (`PLAN-ShellGates-001.R3`, `NG5`). Never
    buffer the whole stream.
  - `shell/error` (recorded): durable failure detail. Its presence makes the gate
    a coordinator-visible stalled state and causes reed to **skip** the gate on
    later scans until cleared.

- **MI6 — pass outcome rides ordinary workflow vocabulary only
  (`PLAN-ShellGates-001.A4`, `S3`).** On a zero exit, close the gate with
  `(workflow/complete! run-id {:step gate-id :by "shell" :notes <short summary>})`
  (surfacing as `workflow/outcome-by "shell"` / `workflow/notes`, mirroring
  treadle), and record `shell/exit-code 0` and bounded `shell/output`. Introduce
  **no** new `workflow/*` attribute. The worker clears the `shell/running` claim
  on every terminal outcome (the closed gate makes it moot on pass; on fail the
  gate carries only `shell/error`, so recovery is "clear `shell/error`" —
  `PLAN-ShellGates-001.A6`).

- **MI7 — loud, distinct failure (`PLAN-ShellGates-001.A5`, G3/S4).** A non-zero
  exit, timeout, spawn error, or invalid argv does **not** close the gate and does
  **not** masquerade as a failed run. reed stamps `shell/error` (with
  `shell/exit-code` and bounded `shell/output` where a process ran) and leaves the
  gate ready and stamped.

- **MI8 — deterministic skip + claim/recovery predicate
  (`PLAN-ShellGates-001.A6`, `.R2`, `.R6`).** A gate carrying `shell/error` or a
  live `shell/running` claim is **skipped** on every later scan. Clearing
  `shell/error` (and any lingering claim) makes the next scan find a ready,
  un-errored, un-claimed `:shell` gate and re-run the deterministic check. The
  claim is stamped before dispatch and skipped thereafter (idempotent, no
  double-launch under concurrent/initial scans). A crash between claim and outcome
  leaves `shell/running` with no live process, recoverable by the same
  clear-to-retry path.

- **MI9 — `gate-stalled?` (`PLAN-ShellGates-001.A7`).** Given a ready `:shell`
  gate view, return durable stall detail (`{:gate <id> :error <detail>}`) when the
  gate carries `shell/error`, else nil. Strictly simpler than treadle's — the
  failure detail lives on the gate itself, so there is no `delegates`-edge join
  back to a run row.

- **MI10 — `install!` registrations (`PLAN-ShellGates-001.A7`).** In `install!`:
  register the event handler (MI2); call
  `(workflow/register-executor! :shell gate-stalled?)`; register a named query
  `'stalled-shell-gates` for active `:shell` gates carrying `shell/error`
  (`[:and [:= :state "active"] [:= [:attr "workflow/gate"] "shell"]
  [:exists [:attr "shell/error"]]]` — no `delegates`-edge join is needed); run the
  initial scan. No CLI op, no JSON socket op (`S2`, TEN-006).

- **MI11 — new test file `test/skein/spools/reed_test.clj`, ns
  `skein.spools.reed-test`** (classpath-spool test placement, mirroring
  `test/skein/spools/loom_test.clj` / `carder_test.clj`). Drive the event-fired
  contract with `skein.spools.test-support/with-runtime` + `poll-until` (the
  treadle `with-runtime` precedent, `PLAN-ShellGates-001.V4`/`Q2` resolution — an
  in-process real runtime firing events synchronously; do NOT stand up a socket
  weaver). Use real, deterministic, POSIX-portable commands only — `true`,
  `false`, `["sh" "-c" "…"]` fixtures, `test -s <fixture>` — never any harness
  (`PLAN-ShellGates-001.R5`). Cover the full `PLAN-ShellGates-001.P5` matrix:
  - **pass**: exit-0 command closes the gate, records `workflow/outcome-by
    "shell"`, `shell/exit-code 0`, bounded `shell/output`; the dependent step
    becomes ready.
  - **fail**: a non-zero command stamps `shell/error` + `shell/exit-code` +
    captured output, leaves the gate ready and stamped, and `gate-stalled?` /
    `stalled-shell-gates` report it.
  - **recovery**: fixing the artifact and clearing `shell/error` re-runs the check
    on the next scan and closes the gate; assert a stamped `shell/error` gate is
    **not** re-run on unrelated graph events (the expensive check runs once, not
    per mutation).
  - **invalid argv**: missing / blank / non-array / non-string-element
    `shell/argv` fails loudly onto `shell/error` with **no** process spawned.
  - **timeout**: a command exceeding `shell/timeout-secs` is killed and stamped
    `shell/error`; a non-positive/non-integer `shell/timeout-secs` fails loudly.
  - **isolation**: a non-`:shell` gate (waiter `:subagent`/`:ci`/`:human`) is
    never touched; assert the `shell/output` bound on large output.
  - **composition**: a `:self`/`:subagent` step feeding a dependent `:shell` gate
    runs the check only once its dependency closes.
  - **state-shape**: `state-shape-matches-declared-version` via
    `test-support/assert-state-shape` against `#'reed/new-state`.

## P3 Done when

- **DW1** `spools/src/skein/spools/reed.clj` and `test/skein/spools/reed_test.clj`
  exist per P2 and the full test suite is green:
  ```sh
  cd /Users/ct/dev/projects/skein-src__workflow-shell-gates
  PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk/bin:$PATH" /opt/homebrew/opt/util-linux/bin/flock -w 3600 /tmp/skein-test.lock clojure -M:test
  ```
  (the flock gate is mandatory — other agents may be testing concurrently,
  `PLAN-ShellGates-001.V3`.)
- **DW2** quality gates at zero findings:
  ```sh
  make fmt-check && make lint && make reflect-check
  ```
  `make reflect-check` must be clean — process interop (`ProcessBuilder`/`Process`/
  argv `java.util.List`) is a reflection hot spot and must be type-hinted.
- **DW3** `git status --short` shows no generated SQLite/`-wal`/`-shm`/runtime
  artifacts after the run (`PLAN-ShellGates-001.V3`).
- **DW4** one atomic commit on `workflow-shell-gates` containing exactly three
  files: `reed.clj`, `reed_test.clj`, and the `tasks/index.yml` edit flipping
  this task's `status` to `complete`.

## P4 Out of scope

- **OS1** All docs, the `spools/README.md`/`workflow.md` edits, the generated
  `spools/reed.api.md`, and the `alpha-surface.md` delta merge — Task 002.
- **OS2** `.skein/init.clj` activation and `CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md` spool-list
  entries — Task 003. Do not touch canonical config here.
- **OS3** Everything shuttle-specific (`PLAN-ShellGates-001.P8`): `shuttle/*`
  attributes, `spawn-run!`, the treadle preamble, session resume, `max-attempts`,
  a separate run strand, the `delegates` edge, the blank-result-is-failure rule,
  `treadle/superseded-by` lockstep. reed has no separate run strand.
- **OS4** Any `:ci` waiter / external-check family, named-command argv registry,
  implicit shell wrapping, unbounded output capture, the treadle/`sh` collision
  fix (`NG2`–`NG6`), and the pattern-layer `validation` ergonomic (`NG1`).

## P5 References

- `devflow/feat/workflow-shell-gates/workflow-shell-gates.plan.md`
  (`PLAN-ShellGates-001`) — binds this task: `D1` (naming), `D2` (fixed design),
  `A1`–`A7` (approach), `P5` (test matrix), `P7.R1`–`R6` (risks), `P8` (file-map
  anchors, shuttle-specific exclusions, tenets).
- `spools/shuttle/src/skein/spools/treadle.clj` + `test/skein/treadle_test.clj` —
  the reference executor and its event-fired `with-runtime`/`poll-until` test.
- `spools/src/skein/spools/workflow.clj` — `active-runs`, `next-steps`,
  `complete!` (requires `:by` on a gate), `register-executor!`,
  `register-query!`; `spools/src/skein/spools/loom.clj` for classpath-spool shape.
- `test/skein/spools/test_support.clj` — `with-runtime`, `poll-until`,
  `assert-state-shape`, `await-budget-ms`.
- `spools/src/skein/spools/util.clj` — `fail!`, `attr-get`.
- `skein.spools.shuttle` — inspect only for the worker-pool runtime-stop lifecycle
  pattern (MI3); do not couple reed to it.

## Operational constraints (every task)

- NEVER start, stop, restart, or reload the canonical mill or weaver (workspace
  `/Users/ct/dev/projects/skein-src/.skein`). This is code + tests; all runtime
  testing runs through the in-process `with-runtime` test runtime (or a disposable
  `--workspace "$(mktemp -d)"`), never the canonical world.
- Work only in the worktree. Commit atomically on `workflow-shell-gates`. Never
  `--no-verify`. Kill any stray process by PID only.
