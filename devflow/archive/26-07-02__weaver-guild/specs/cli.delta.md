# CLI Surface delta for weaver-guild

**Document ID:** `DELTA-Cli-002`
**Root spec:** [cli.md](../../../specs/cli.md)
**Feature:** [../proposal.md](../proposal.md)
**Status:** Merged
**Last Updated:** 2026-07-02

## DELTA-Cli-002.P1 Summary

Returns `config.json` to version control (its gitignore entry is a stale
leftover from when it stored the machine-local Skein source checkout path,
pre-mill), extends the alpha config format with an optional portable weaver
`"name"`, and adds a machine-local `config.local.json` overlay. No new CLI
commands. Companion to
[daemon-runtime.delta.md](./daemon-runtime.delta.md) CC5/CC6/D3.

## DELTA-Cli-002.P2 Contract changes

- **DELTA-Cli-002.CC1:** Amends `SPEC-002.C2`: the alpha config format
  supports the `configFormat` marker plus an optional non-blank string
  `"name"` declaring the workspace's portable logical weaver name. Unknown
  keys and wrong value types still fail loudly. `config.json` remains
  non-authoritative for source checkout paths.
- **DELTA-Cli-002.CC2:** A machine-local `config.local.json` overlay may sit
  beside `config.json`. It is a shallow overlay of the same optional keys
  (`"name"`; it does not carry `configFormat`), following the existing
  shared/local layering convention of `spools.edn`/`spools.local.edn`. A
  missing overlay contributes nothing; a malformed present overlay fails
  loudly.
- **DELTA-Cli-002.CC3:** Amends `SPEC-002.C14a`: bootstrap-generated
  `.skein/.gitignore` no longer ignores `config.json` and ignores
  `config.local.json` instead. Bootstrap still never overwrites existing
  user files; already-generated `.gitignore` files in existing repos are
  user-owned and are not migrated (TEN-000).
- **DELTA-Cli-002.CC4:** Amends `SPEC-002.C16`: when `weaver start` is given
  no explicit `--name`, mill resolves the friendly name from
  `config.local.json` `"name"`, then `config.json` `"name"`, then the
  selected workspace basename. An explicit `--name` remains the top
  override.

## DELTA-Cli-002.P3 Design decisions

### DELTA-Cli-002.D1 config.json is shareable config again

- **Decision:** `config.json` is checked-in shared workspace config; only
  `config.local.json` (and the existing local overlays) stay gitignored.
- **Rationale:** The original reason for ignoring it — it stored the
  machine-local source checkout path — was removed by the mill migration
  (`SPEC-002.C2` already forbids source paths in it). Re-sharing it lets a
  repo declare portable identity data that mill can read before the weaver
  JVM exists; see [daemon-runtime.delta.md](./daemon-runtime.delta.md) D3
  for the naming decision and rejected alternatives.
- **Rejected:** Keeping `config.json` machine-local and adding a separate
  checked-in identity file (a second config file with one key, pure surface
  growth — TEN-004).

## DELTA-Cli-002.P4 Open questions

- **DELTA-Cli-002.Q1:** None; naming questions live in
  DELTA-DaemonRuntime-002.Q1.
