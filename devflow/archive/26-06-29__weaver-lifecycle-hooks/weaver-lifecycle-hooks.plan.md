## WLH-PLAN-001.P1 Goal and scope

Deliver the reviewed Weaver Lifecycle Hooks contracts as a weaver-owned, trusted, synchronous hook system. The feature adds runtime hook registration and introspection, explicit attribute-normalization transforms, pre-commit mutation validation for blessed mutation APIs, received-payload gates for selected JSON socket operations, and preserved post-commit event behavior.

## WLH-PLAN-001.P2 Approach

- **WLH-PLAN-001.A1:** Build the hook system parallel to events but without an async worker: runtime owns a hook registry atom, `skein.weaver.api` owns validation/registration/invocation, and `skein.hooks.alpha` mirrors the existing `skein.events.alpha` direct-or-connected helper pattern.
- **WLH-PLAN-001.A2:** Implement a small hook runner before broad integration. It should resolve function symbols through the runtime library classloader, sort by `:order` then key `pr-str`, invoke validation hooks by ignored return value, invoke transform hooks by threading strict `{:hook/value ...}` wrappers, and wrap failures as `hook/failed` while preserving cause data.
- **WLH-PLAN-001.A3:** Integrate hooks at blessed weaver API entry points rather than in lower-level storage functions. Direct trusted calls to `skein.db` remain outside the hook guarantee.
- **WLH-PLAN-001.A4:** Normalize strand attributes before final candidate validation for add, update, transactional graph batch created/updated entries, and pattern-produced create-only batch entries. Edge attribute normalization is out of scope.
- **WLH-PLAN-001.A5:** Add pre-commit hooks where mutation failure can abort the transaction and prevent post-commit events: add, update including candidate edge operations, supersede, burn, apply-batch, and weave-created batches.
- **WLH-PLAN-001.A6:** Use an uncommitted-write seam rather than a dry-run planner for complex mutations. For supersede, graph batch, and create-only pattern batch, factor storage helpers so the weaver API can open the transaction, perform normal storage validation/mutation against that transaction, receive the uncommitted result/candidate context, invoke hooks before the transaction exits, and rely on transaction rollback if a hook throws. This keeps hook context aligned with committed result shapes without duplicating relation, ref, cycle, and JSON checks outside `skein.db`.
- **WLH-PLAN-001.A7:** Attribute normalization happens before storage helpers that consume attribute maps. Pre-commit validation for complex operations happens after storage helpers produce uncommitted candidate/result data and before commit.
- **WLH-PLAN-001.A8:** Add received-payload hooks in the JSON socket after existing protocol/identity/allowlist/argument validation and before dispatch, only for `add`, `update`, `supersede`, `burn`, `weave`, and `op`. Keep `init`, `status`, `stop`, and read-only operations ungated.
- **WLH-PLAN-001.A9:** Keep successful mutation event emission semantically unchanged; hook-rejected mutations emit no mutation events.

## WLH-PLAN-001.P3 Affected areas

| ID | Area | Expected change |
| -- | ---- | --------------- |
| WLH-PLAN-001.AA1 | `src/skein/weaver/runtime.clj` | Add hook registry runtime state and clear it during startup/reload lifecycle. |
| WLH-PLAN-001.AA2 | `src/skein/weaver/api.clj` | Add hook registration/introspection APIs, runner/error helpers, mutation integration, and reload clearing. |
| WLH-PLAN-001.AA3 | `src/skein/hooks/alpha.clj` | New blessed helper namespace for trusted hook workflows. |
| WLH-PLAN-001.AA4 | `src/skein/client.clj` | Add fixed nREPL operation mappings for hook helper routing. |
| WLH-PLAN-001.AA5 | `src/skein/weaver/socket.clj` | Invoke `:payload/received` hooks for selected JSON socket operations before dispatch. |
| WLH-PLAN-001.AA6 | `src/skein/db.clj` | Factor supersede, graph batch, and create-only pattern batch internals so the weaver API can run hooks after uncommitted mutation result construction and before transaction commit. |
| WLH-PLAN-001.AA7 | `test/skein/*` | Add focused unit/integration coverage for registry, helper routing, hook ordering, failure propagation, mutation aborts, event preservation, reload clearing, socket payload gates, and batch/pattern paths. |
| WLH-PLAN-001.AA8 | `devflow/specs/*`, `dev/skein/smoke.clj`, docs as needed | Promote shipped contracts and add smoke/doc coverage after implementation. |

## WLH-PLAN-001.P4 Contract and migration impact

- **WLH-PLAN-001.CM1:** No SQLite migration or persisted hook state is introduced. Hook registrations are weaver-lifetime runtime state reinstalled by trusted config or REPL workflows.
- **WLH-PLAN-001.CM2:** The public Go CLI surface gains no new commands or flags. Existing commands may fail with a `hook/failed` domain error when selected-world policy rejects them.
- **WLH-PLAN-001.CM3:** `skein.hooks.alpha` becomes a new blessed source-visible namespace, explicit like `skein.events.alpha` and not preloaded into `skein.repl`.
- **WLH-PLAN-001.CM4:** Hook-approved successful mutation result shapes and post-commit events remain compatible with current contracts, except normalized strand attributes may reflect weaver-side transforms.

## WLH-PLAN-001.P5 Implementation phases

### WLH-PLAN-001.PH1 Registry and helper surface

Outcome: Hook registry state, API operations, helper namespace, connected-helper routing, deterministic introspection, and reload clearing exist without yet changing mutation behavior.

### WLH-PLAN-001.PH2 Core hook runner and simple strand mutation gates

Outcome: The hook runner enforces ordering, transform wrappers, and `hook/failed` errors, then gates add/update/burn paths with attribute normalization and pre-commit validation while preserving event semantics.

### WLH-PLAN-001.PH3 Complex mutation seams and gates

Outcome: Supersede, transactional graph batches, and pattern-created batches expose uncommitted result/candidate seams, run the reviewed hooks before commit, and reject atomically when hooks fail.

### WLH-PLAN-001.PH4 JSON socket payload gates

Outcome: Selected public socket operations run validation-only received-payload hooks before dispatch; setup, read-only, and administrative operations remain ungated.

### WLH-PLAN-001.PH5 Final integration, docs, and promotion

Outcome: Helper, CLI, smoke, and root spec documentation are aligned with shipped behavior and the standard project validation suite passes.

## WLH-PLAN-001.P6 Validation strategy

- **WLH-PLAN-001.V1:** Clojure tests prove registry validation, replacement, ordering, helper routing, reload clearing, classloader resolution, and no callable values in introspection.
- **WLH-PLAN-001.V2:** Mutation tests prove transform hooks thread values, no-op transforms must return `{:hook/value ...}`, invalid transforms fail loudly, validation hook failures abort storage writes, and hook-approved mutations still enqueue post-commit events.
- **WLH-PLAN-001.V3:** Batch/pattern tests prove common batch context shape, per-strand normalization, all-or-nothing rejection, and single policy pass for `weave`.
- **WLH-PLAN-001.V4:** Socket tests prove payload hooks run only for `add`, `update`, `supersede`, `burn`, `weave`, and `op`, see string-keyed pre-normalization args, and do not gate `init`, `status`, `stop`, `show`, `list`, `ready`, or `pattern-explain`.
- **WLH-PLAN-001.V5:** Standard validation remains `PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk/bin:$PATH" clojure -M:test`, `(cd cli && go test ./...)`, and `PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk/bin:$PATH" clojure -M:smoke`.

## WLH-PLAN-001.P7 Risks and open questions

- **WLH-PLAN-001.R1:** Complex mutation hooks may require deeper factoring of `skein.db` than the simpler add/update/burn paths. Mitigation: use uncommitted-write seams for supersede, graph batch, and create-only pattern batch, and require tests that compare hook context to committed result shapes.
- **WLH-PLAN-001.R2:** Hook contexts can become too broad or inconsistent across entry points. Mitigation: use the feature deltas as the contract source and make common shape assertions in tests.
- **WLH-PLAN-001.R3:** Wrapping all hook failures as `hook/failed` could hide user policy details. Mitigation: require `:hook/cause-code` and original `ex-info` data in error details.
- **WLH-PLAN-001.Q1:** None blocking task generation.

## WLH-PLAN-001.P8 Task context

- **WLH-PLAN-001.TC1:** The reviewed contract lives in `proposal.md` and the three feature spec deltas. Do not re-open RFC alternatives while implementing tasks unless a task discovers a concrete contradiction.
- **WLH-PLAN-001.TC2:** Existing event code is the closest registry/helper pattern, but hook failures propagate synchronously and must not use the event worker or recent-failure queue.
- **WLH-PLAN-001.TC3:** Keep the CLI thin. Hook registration, listing, and debugging stay in `skein.hooks.alpha` / trusted REPL workflows, not Go commands.
- **WLH-PLAN-001.TC4:** Direct `skein.db` use by trusted code bypasses hooks by design. The blessed weaver API and alpha helpers are the policy-gated path.
- **WLH-PLAN-001.TC5:** Prefer explicit failure over fallback behavior. If a hook context cannot be constructed with required data, fail the operation loudly rather than silently skipping the hook.

## WLH-PLAN-001.P9 Developer Notes

Append notes here. Do not rewrite earlier notes.

### WLH-PLAN-001.DN1 Task queue authoring — 2026-06-29

- Created eight AFK tasks covering registry/helper surface, hook runner and normalization, simple mutation gates, supersession seam, graph batch gate, pattern weave gate, socket payload hooks, and final spec promotion/validation.
- Review found no remaining blockers after context-key amendments to Tasks 3-6.

### WLH-PLAN-001.DN2 Task 1 implementation — 2026-06-29

- Added hook registry state/API/helpers without mutation invocation. Registry stores resolved callables internally and returns data-first introspection only.
- Validation passed: `PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk/bin:$PATH" clojure -M:test`, `(cd cli && go test ./...)`, and `PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk/bin:$PATH" clojure -M:smoke`.

### WLH-PLAN-001.DN3 Task 2 implementation — 2026-06-29

- Added deterministic synchronous hook runners in `skein.weaver.api` and integrated `:attributes/normalize` for simple add/update attribute patches only.
- Transform failures and thrown hook policy errors are wrapped as `hook/failed`; normalized attributes are rechecked through existing JSON attribute encoding before storage.
- Validation passed: `PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk/bin:$PATH" clojure -M:test`, `(cd cli && go test ./...)`, and `PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk/bin:$PATH" clojure -M:smoke`.

### WLH-PLAN-001.DN4 Task 3 implementation — 2026-06-29

- Gated `api/add`, `api/update`, and `api/burn-by-ids` with validation-only pre-commit lifecycle hooks inside mutation transactions before event enqueue.
- Update hook context includes edge operation candidates requested by update patches; hook rejection rolls back strand and edge writes and leaves post-commit event queues untouched.
- Validation passed: `PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk/bin:$PATH" clojure -M:test`, `(cd cli && go test ./...)`, and `PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk/bin:$PATH" clojure -M:smoke`.

### WLH-PLAN-001.DN5 Task 4 implementation — 2026-06-29

- Factored `db/supersede-strand-in-transaction!` so `api/supersede` can run normal supersession mutation in its own transaction, invoke `:strand/supersede-before-commit`, and commit only after hook approval.
- Supersede hook context carries old/replacement ids, normalized old before/after rows, supersedes edge candidate, and rewired dependency candidate data; rejection rolls back state, supersedes edge, rewiring, and event enqueue.
- Validation passed: `PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk/bin:$PATH" clojure -M:test`, `(cd cli && go test ./...)`, and `PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk/bin:$PATH" clojure -M:smoke`.

### WLH-PLAN-001.DN6 Task 5 implementation — 2026-06-29

- Factored graph batch mutation with `db/apply-batch-in-transaction!` so `api/apply-batch` owns the transaction, normalizes per-strand batch attributes, invokes `:batch/apply-before-commit`, and enqueues events only after hook approval.
- Batch hook context uses the common apply schema with normalized payload/result data; hook rejection rolls back mixed create/update/edge/burn work atomically.
- Kept the MVP seam narrow: direct `db/apply-batch!` behavior remains unchanged and no CLI batch surface was added.
- Validation passed: `PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk/bin:$PATH" clojure -M:test`, `(cd cli && go test ./...)`, and `PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk/bin:$PATH" clojure -M:smoke`.

### WLH-PLAN-001.DN7 Task 6 implementation — 2026-06-29

- Factored create-only pattern batch storage with `db/add-strand-batch-in-transaction!` so `api/weave!` can normalize attributes, run storage mutation in an API-owned transaction, invoke `:batch/apply-before-commit`, then commit only after hook approval.
- Pattern weave hook context uses the common batch schema with `:batch/source :weave`, normalized create-only payload, final refs/created rows/edge operations, empty updated/burned vectors, and pattern name/input.
- Direct `db/add-strand-batch!` preserves its public `{:created ... :refs ...}` result shape; hook-rejected weave rolls back created rows/edges and emits no events.
- Validation passed: `PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk/bin:$PATH" clojure -M:test`, `(cd cli && go test ./...)`, and `PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk/bin:$PATH" clojure -M:smoke`.

### WLH-PLAN-001.DN8 Task 7 implementation — 2026-06-29

- Added JSON socket `:payload/received` validation hooks after protocol/identity/allowlist/argument-shape validation and before dispatch for `add`, `update`, `supersede`, `burn`, `weave`, and `op` only.
- Payload context preserves string-keyed decoded request arguments/options before socket dispatch reshaping; hook failures propagate as domain `hook/failed` socket envelopes and prevent dispatch.
- Confirmed setup, admin, read-only, query, and pattern explanation operations stay ungated, including `stop`.
- Validation passed: `PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk/bin:$PATH" clojure -M:test`, `(cd cli && go test ./...)`, and `PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk/bin:$PATH" clojure -M:smoke`.

### WLH-PLAN-001.DN9 Task 8 final promotion — 2026-06-29

- Promoted lifecycle hook contracts into root CLI, REPL API, and Weaver Runtime specs; marked feature-local deltas as merged and refreshed the devflow spec index text.
- Extended smoke coverage so an isolated config-dir installs a hook from trusted startup config and rejects a CLI mutation with `hook/failed`.
- No cut scope in this slice; archiving the feature folder remains outside Task 8.
- Validation passed: `PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk/bin:$PATH" clojure -M:test`, `(cd cli && go test ./...)`, and `PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk/bin:$PATH" clojure -M:smoke`. `git status --short` showed no generated SQLite/runtime metadata artifacts.

### WLH-PLAN-001.DN10 Finish/archive — 2026-06-29

- Shipped scope: synchronous trusted lifecycle hook registry, `skein.hooks.alpha` helpers, JSON socket payload gates for mutation/userland operations, attribute normalization transforms, pre-commit policy hooks for strand and batch/pattern mutation paths, and `hook/failed` propagation.
- Promoted durable contracts into canonical root specs before archive; feature-local deltas remain marked `Merged` as historical staging artifacts.
- Archived implemented RFC-008 with this feature. No cut, deferred, or unpromoted scope.
