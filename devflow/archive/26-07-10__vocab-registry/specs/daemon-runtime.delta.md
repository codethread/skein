# Weaver Runtime delta for vocab-registry

**Document ID:** `SPEC-Vr-004` **Root spec:** [daemon-runtime.md](../../../specs/daemon-runtime.md) (`SPEC-004`)
**Feature:** [../proposal.md](../proposal.md) (`PROP-Vr-001`) **Contract:** [../brief.md](../brief.md) **Status:** No
change — kept for delta-set completeness **Last Updated:** 2026-07-10

## SPEC-Vr-004.P1 Summary

**No weaver-runtime contract change.** F4's backing store is runtime-owned per-runtime state acquired through
`skein.api.runtime.alpha/spool-state` (`PROP-Vr-001.C2`), the sole accessor `SPEC-004.C95` already governs, versioned per
the shape-drift discipline that clause already prescribes. The registry survives `reload!` like every other spool-state
entry (`SPEC-004.C95`), and its declare-time behavior — same-owner idempotent replace, cross-owner loud failure
(`PROP-Vr-001.C3`) — is ordinary module activation, not a new runtime primitive. So none of the registry, the seed, the
`strand vocab` op, or the two consumers touches the weaver runtime, transports, or registries `SPEC-004` governs. This file
records the disposition explicitly so the F4 delta set mirrors F3's per-root-spec coverage (`SPEC-Np-004`).

## SPEC-Vr-004.P2 Contract changes

- None. `SPEC-004.C95` describes the versioned spool-state mechanism generically and enumerates no per-consumer state:
  spool-state survives `reload!`, a consumer whose map shape changed declares a `version` so a preserved shape-mismatched
  value reinits rather than silently reusing. The registry is exactly such a consumer (versioned map, `PROP-Vr-001.C2`,
  `R4`), so it *uses* `C95` and adds no runtime text. Unlike the scheduler (`SPEC-004.C97`), which earned a dedicated
  clause because it holds shape-sensitive executors and timers, the registry holds only in-memory declaration maps — no
  executors, no timers, no reload-armed resources — so it warrants no dedicated `SPEC-004` clause.
- Reload re-registration is covered by the same generic mechanism. On `reload!` every owning spool's `install!` re-runs
  against the surviving registry; a same-owner re-declaration is the idempotent replace (`PROP-Vr-001.C3`), so a reload
  never self-collides — the C96 hazard of a value change leaving a world unusable does not arise, because the collision is
  strictly cross-owner. A cross-owner claim is genuinely conflicting installed code and *should* abort loudly: `declare!`
  throws, the declaring module's `install!` raises, and `use!` records a failed module-use outcome (`SPEC-004.C46`). This
  is the feature's one hard edge (`PROP-Vr-001.C3`, `G5`), not the `SPEC-004.C96` preamble-consumer clash-replace path,
  which governs a different reload-surviving consumer whose contract is to never abort startup.

## SPEC-Vr-004.P3 Flagged (out of scope for F4)

- **SPEC-Vr-004.F1:** None. No storage-kind, weaver-status, transport, event, scheduler, hook, or CLI-operation-registry
  contract moves. The registry introduces no new weaver-API operation: `declare!`/`declarations`/`declaration` are
  domain-namespace functions on `skein.api.vocab.alpha` (`SPEC-005.C2`), not `skein.api.weaver.alpha` primitives, and they
  read/write only the runtime's own spool-state through the `SPEC-004.C95` accessor. The `strand vocab` op registers
  through the existing batteries `op-registrations` path (`SPEC-004.C63a`) with no new dispatcher or registry surface.
