# Storage-Safety Docs Sweep Proposal

**Document ID:** `PROP-StorageDocs-001`
**Last Updated:** 2026-07-13
**Related RFCs:** None
**Related root specs:** [SPEC-001 Strand Model](../../specs/strand-model.md)
**Related proposals:** [PROP-Tomb-001 Burn Tombstones](../26-07-12__burn-tombstones/proposal.md), [PROP-Immut-001 Immutable Keys](../26-07-13__immutable-keys/proposal.md)

## PROP-StorageDocs-001.P1 Problem

Two storage-safety features have landed since the docs were written, and the
prose has not caught up in two opposite directions.

Under-claiming: note memory is now storage-enforced write-once (`note/text` and
`note/at`, SPEC-001.P4/P8), but most surfaces still describe it as an
"append-only" or "immutable note" *convention*. The root spec already says
enforcement is real — `devflow/specs/strand-model.md:46-48,84-86` declare
`note/text`/`note/at` write-once — and `skein.api.notes.alpha` with its
generated reference mirrors it, but every other mention reads as an
honor-system promise the reader has no reason to trust. Burn is worse: it
now writes a durable forensic tombstone on every path (SPEC-001.P3/P8), and the
user reference `docs/skein.md` still describes burn as plain deletion with no
mention of the tombstone, the REPL recovery surface, or the recovery caveats.

Over-claiming risk: the same word family — "immutable", "never mutated in
place" — is also used for whole-strand and whole-subgraph patterns (agent-run
supersession, workflow revise rounds) that the immutable-keys registry does
*not* enforce. A careless sweep that restates every hit as a storage guarantee
would promise durability the storage layer never provides.

## PROP-StorageDocs-001.P2 Goals

- **PROP-StorageDocs-001.G1:** Every doc surface that describes note memory as a
  convention is restated as the enforced guarantee it now is, borrowing the
  precision already shipped in `skein.api.notes.alpha`: the note strand is
  born-closed and its `note/text`/`note/at` content is write-once by storage
  enforcement (SPEC-001.P4), while the strand stays open to writer-owned
  decorating attributes.
- **PROP-StorageDocs-001.G2:** The user reference `docs/skein.md` describes burn
  honestly: every burn records a forensic tombstone, recovery is a human REPL
  activity (`skein.repl/burn-history`, `recent-burns`), and it is hand-recovery
  not undo — a replay mints a new id and inbound edges from unburned strands are
  not restored.
- **PROP-StorageDocs-001.G3:** A recovery cookbook entry walks tombstone →
  batch-replay payload, calling out the new-id caveat, so a coordinator in a
  disaster-recovery session has a written path instead of raw SQL.
- **PROP-StorageDocs-001.G4:** Agent-facing note discipline prose points at the
  enforced-error reality: a rewrite of note content now throws, it is not merely
  discouraged; burn is the explicit escape hatch.

## PROP-StorageDocs-001.P3 Non-goals

- **PROP-StorageDocs-001.NG1:** No behavior change, no new API surface, no CLI
  surface. This is a prose-and-docstring sweep only.
- **PROP-StorageDocs-001.NG2:** No overclaiming beyond the two shipped
  guarantees. Whole-strand "never mutated in place" (agent-run supersession) and
  "fresh immutable subgraph" (workflow revise rounds) describe design patterns,
  not immutable-keys enforcement; only `note/text`/`note/at` are registered. Those
  hits are left as-is, not restated as storage guarantees.
- **PROP-StorageDocs-001.NG3:** `skein.api.notes.alpha` docstrings and their
  generated reference (`docs/api/notes.api.md`) were already updated by
  PROP-Immut-001 and are the model to mirror, not a surface to re-edit.
- **PROP-StorageDocs-001.NG4:** No retention/GC or programmatic tombstone
  surface — those remain deferred (SPEC-001.P10); the recovery cookbook documents
  the REPL-only surface that shipped.

## PROP-StorageDocs-001.P4 Proposed scope

The classified claim inventory below is the full scope; each surface is cited
by verifiable `file:line`. Three buckets:

- **PROP-StorageDocs-001.S1 (restate as enforced guarantee):** note-memory
  convention prose is aligned to the enforced write-once reality. Hand-authored
  prose edited directly: `docs/skein.md:256`, `spools/README.md:41`,
  `spools/agent-run/README.md:214,217,275-276`, `spools/delegation/README.md:33,219-220`.
  The `spools/agent-run/README.md:217,275-276` note-vocabulary claims also carry
  the wrong attribute names (`agent-run/note-for`, `agent-run/note`,
  `agent-run/note-by`, `agent-run/round`, `agent-run/at`) and are corrected to
  the shipped vocabulary — `note/text` + `note/at`, with optional `note/by` /
  `note/round` (`src/skein/api/notes/alpha.clj:71-79`) — so the contract doc
  stops contradicting the code it describes. Docstring sources edited, with
  `make api-docs` regenerating their `.api.md` counterparts:
  `spools/batteries/src/skein/spools/batteries.clj:335,472`
  (→ `spools/batteries.api.md:73`),
  `spools/agent-run/src/skein/spools/agent_run.clj:13,2335`
  (→ `spools/agent-run.api.md:17,268`),
  `spools/delegation/src/skein/spools/delegation.clj:388-389`, and the
  generated-help op doc `spools/delegation/src/skein/spools/delegation.clj:1951`
  (`"Append an immutable note to a strand."`, the `strand agent help` entry),
  `src/skein/api/relations/alpha.clj:35`, and — if touched —
  `src/skein/api/vocab/alpha.clj:106`. Restatements borrow the shipped
  `notes.alpha` precision (content write-once, strand still decoratable); none
  claim whole-strand immutability.
- **PROP-StorageDocs-001.S2 (burn honesty + recovery cookbook):** `docs/skein.md`
  burn prose (the strand-model section ~line 226 and the command list ~line 157)
  gains the tombstone reality — every burn records a forensic tombstone, recovery
  is REPL-only, hand-recovery not undo. A recovery cookbook entry (tombstone →
  batch-replay payload → new-id caveat, inbound edges need re-pointing) is added
  to the `docs/skein.md` REPL section, since no spool owns the burn-tombstone
  surface (it lives in `skein.repl` + `skein.core.db`).
- **PROP-StorageDocs-001.S3 (discipline prose):** agent-facing note discipline —
  `spools/delegation/README.md:220` and the `delegation.clj:388-389` op docstring
  ("append-only memory, not mutation") — is tightened to name the enforced-error
  reality (a note-content rewrite throws; burn is the escape hatch).

Left untouched as correct-but-not-enforced (PROP-StorageDocs-001.NG2):
`spools/workflow.md:335`, `spools/workflow.cookbook.md:107` (immutable subgraph),
`spools/agent-run.api.md:37` / `agent_run.clj:33` (run never mutated in place).
Left untouched as a historical record: the "append-only run memory" phrase at
`devflow/README.md:53` is a dated entry under `## Archived features` describing
what the `26-07-02__shuttle-spool` feature shipped, not live guidance prose;
restating a changelog line to reflect enforcement that landed afterward would
falsify the record. The live twin of that phrase — the spool index at
`spools/README.md:41` — is in S1 scope above.
Unrelated hits (skein-prime file injection, the Selvage violation log, carder's
read-only guarantee, the worker-contract "never mutate sibling strands" scope
rule, the immutable clojure.basis launch file) are out of scope.

## PROP-StorageDocs-001.P5 Open questions

- **PROP-StorageDocs-001.Q1:** Recovery cookbook home. No spool owns burn
  tombstones, so the cookbook lands in `docs/skein.md`'s REPL section rather than
  a `spools/*.cookbook.md`. Proposed above; confirm at design signoff if a
  standalone recovery doc is preferred.
