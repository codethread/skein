# Task 7: Acceptance and SPEC-004 delta promotion (PH5)

**Document ID:** `TASK-cron-on-scheduler-007`

## TASK-cron-on-scheduler-007.P1 Scope

Type: AFK

Final acceptance for cron-on-scheduler (`PLAN-cron-on-scheduler-001.PH5`): promote
the staged `SPEC-004` retirement delta into the root spec, then run the full
locked suite, Go tests, smoke, and quality gates green with a clean
`git status --short`. No feature code changes — only the spec promotion and gate
runs; a red gate is a defect to route back, not to patch here.

## TASK-cron-on-scheduler-007.P2 Must implement exactly

- **TASK-cron-on-scheduler-007.MI1:** Promote `DELTA-cron-on-scheduler-runtime-001`
  into `devflow/specs/daemon-runtime.md`: amend `SPEC-004.C102` to name retirement
  as the second generation-sensitive transition and add `SPEC-004.C102b`
  (generation-aware retirement, cancel-by-key stays key-based), per
  `DELTA-cron-on-scheduler-runtime-001.CC1`/`CC2`. Reconcile the finish-time cleanup
  flagged in `PLAN-cron-on-scheduler-001.DN1` (the stale cron mention in
  `SPEC-004.C1a`) and the `specs/README.md` one-delta record
  (`PLAN-cron-on-scheduler-001.CM1`/`.V6`).
- **TASK-cron-on-scheduler-007.MI2:** Confirm `V6`: the only source diffs to the
  scheduler primitive across the feature are the task-1 retirement mechanic and its
  focused tests — no other reshaping (`PLAN-cron-on-scheduler-001.NG1`).
- **TASK-cron-on-scheduler-007.MI3:** Run the acceptance gates (see `DW1`).

## TASK-cron-on-scheduler-007.P3 Done when

- **TASK-cron-on-scheduler-007.DW1:** All green
  (`PLAN-cron-on-scheduler-001.PH5`/`.V7`):
  - `flock -w 3600 /tmp/skein-test.lock clojure -M:test` (full locked suite);
  - `(cd cli && go test ./...)`;
  - `clojure -M:smoke`;
  - `make fmt-check lint reflect-check docs-check`.
- **TASK-cron-on-scheduler-007.DW2:** The scheduler suites
  (`skein.core.scheduler-test`, `skein.scheduler-runtime-test`,
  `skein.api.scheduler.alpha-test`, `skein.scheduler-e2e-test`) are green and
  primitive diffs are bounded to the PH0 retirement mechanic (`.V6`).
- **TASK-cron-on-scheduler-007.DW3:** `git status --short` is clean of stray
  generated SQLite / runtime-metadata artifacts; the only intended generated diff
  is `spools/cron.api.md` (from task 6).

## TASK-cron-on-scheduler-007.P4 Out of scope

- **TASK-cron-on-scheduler-007.OS1:** No feature implementation or test authoring —
  those are tasks 1–6. If a gate fails, record the failure in a note and route it
  back to the owning slice rather than patching here.
- **TASK-cron-on-scheduler-007.OS2:** Landing/merge is coordinator-only; this slice
  stops at implemented + committed with green gates.
