## PROP-Ttv-001.P1 Problem

Two landings since this proposal was first drafted shipped part of its own
scope, so the problem has shifted. A blessed focused entrypoint now exists: focused
runner v1 (commit 2bf5f80) accepts `clojure -M:test <ns...>` and runs the named
namespaces in-process on the correct `:test`-alias classpath, validating each
against the runner's declared island sets (`validate-focused!`) and failing
loudly on an unknown or shard-only namespace. Deterministic test time (commit
a11c915, RFC-Dtt-001) then shrank the serial island: the full suite is now
~40s wall, the serial island is ~18.8s across 5 namespaces, and the floor is the
add-libs shard A subprocess at 35-45s.

The remaining problem is twofold. First, the focused entrypoint and the fast
suite both exist, yet the standing guidance surfaces agents copy from —
AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md testing rules, the agents spool policy prose, and the
pending `attr-scaling-ship-now` queue — still prescribe the full locked suite
per slice (the archived deterministic-test-time plan already used focused
per-slice runs, but nothing durable prescribes that convention). AGENTS.md
prescribes
`flock -w 3600 /tmp/skein-test.lock clojure -M:test` as the safe test command,
so plan and task authors rationally copy it into every AFK slice's Done-when
block. A serial queue of N slices then pays N full-suite runs under a lock
contended by sibling features, when a focused run of the touched namespaces
would gate the slice correctly. Second, even the focused run pays JVM boot every
invocation, so there is no warm loop for sub-second iteration while a slice is in
flight.

Evidence (point-in-time observations, 2026-07-08/09; timings measured on the
development host and expected to drift): macros tasks 001/002 Done-when blocks,
plan PLAN-Srm-001.V1 ("full suite after every slice"), session timeline
analysis on kanban card `n7aya`; the currently pending `attr-scaling-ship-now`
queue repeats the same full-suite-per-slice prescription.

## PROP-Ttv-001.P2 Goals

- **PROP-Ttv-001.G1:** (shipped) A blessed focused test entrypoint exists:
  agents run a chosen subset of test namespaces with the correct `:test`-alias
  classpath while the runner keeps honoring parallel/serial island placement.
  This is stated as the baseline the remaining scope builds on, not proposed.
- **PROP-Ttv-001.G2:** (shipped) A focused run of an undeclared test namespace
  fails loudly (TEN-003), so island placement stays the single source of truth;
  add-libs shard namespaces are likewise rejected from focused mode in v1. The
  error carries the known namespaces in its ex-data, routing authors of a new
  test namespace to the declaration site.
- **PROP-Ttv-001.G3:** A documented tiered validation convention: a warm REPL
  to iterate, a cold focused run (`clojure -M:test <ns...>`) as the slice
  Done-when gate, and the full locked suite exactly once at queue acceptance and
  again at land `merge-local-verify`. Warm results never stand in for the cold
  focused gate.
- **PROP-Ttv-001.G4:** Guidance that plan/task authors actually copy prescribes
  the tiers: the AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md testing rules, the agents spool
  `:task-sizing`/policy prose (with `make api-docs` regen), and the pending
  `attr-scaling-ship-now` task queue.
- **PROP-Ttv-001.G5:** The tiers compose with locking without reintroducing
  one-suite-at-a-time serialization. The full locked suite runs under
  `flock -w 3600 /tmp/skein-test.lock clojure -M:test` (bare `flock` is on PATH
  via nix); focused and warm iteration do not take that lock.
- **PROP-Ttv-001.G6:** A warm test REPL gives sub-second focused iteration,
  scoped to the worktree as the ownership unit and reusing the cold runner's
  namespace validation so warm and cold reject identically.

## PROP-Ttv-001.P3 Non-goals

- **PROP-Ttv-001.NG1:** No change to what the full suite covers, its island
  assignments, or its wall-clock profile; RFC-016's structure is consumed, not
  revised.
- **PROP-Ttv-001.NG2:** No per-var/per-test selection or test frameworks;
  namespace granularity only (TEN-004).
- **PROP-Ttv-001.NG3:** The land workflow's `merge-local-verify` full gate and
  CI are unchanged; tiers apply to per-slice validation, not to landing.
- **PROP-Ttv-001.NG4:** No changes to the external devflow.spool or the
  devflow plugin's authoring references — neither prescribes full-suite runs;
  the prescriptions live in this repo's guidance.

## PROP-Ttv-001.P4 Proposed scope

- **PROP-Ttv-001.S2:** The tiered validation convention is documented where
  agents read testing rules (AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md), stating when a slice uses a
  warm or cold focused run, when the full locked suite is required, and the lock
  command for the full tier.
- **PROP-Ttv-001.S3:** The agents spool manual's `:task-sizing`/policy prose
  prescribes tiered validation for delegated task contracts (regen the
  `about` manual with `make api-docs`).
- **PROP-Ttv-001.S4:** The pending `attr-scaling-ship-now` task queue is swept
  to the tiers: per-slice Done-when blocks become focused namespace runs; the
  full locked suite stays only in its `005-validation-sweep` task; stale
  `flock` paths are corrected.
- **PROP-Ttv-001.S5:** A warm test REPL per worktree: a script entry that
  probes an existing REPL or boots one, idle self-termination, and cleanup on
  worktree removal. The warm side reuses the runner's namespace validation, and
  a warm run never counts as a slice gate — the cold focused run is the
  Done-when gate.
- **PROP-Ttv-001.S6:** Optionally, advisory visibility of live warm REPLs in the
  coordination world, as convenience only — never an authoritative record of
  validation.

## PROP-Ttv-001.P5 Open questions

- **PROP-Ttv-001.Q2:** Whether runner v2 should add shard-focused selection so a
  focused run can target an add-libs shard's namespaces (rejected outright in
  v1) — pursued only if cheap, since the add-libs shard tier shrinks under
  separate card `vk8aa` regardless.
