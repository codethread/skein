## PROP-Wct-001@2.P1 Problem

The delegation spool hardcodes its worker contract and claims the agent-run
preamble-extension seam unconditionally at `install!`, so every preamble-carrying headless
run in every consuming workspace receives the full text. That text mixes three tiers:

- engine-coupled invariants that are true wherever agent-run runs (never close your
  assigned strand, PID-only kills, shallow delegation, durable notes);
- agent-plan task-workflow conventions (`status=implemented` is programmatically consumed
  by plan status; `progress=` and "read your assigned strand" assume a served task),
  injected even for ad-hoc spawns serving no task;
- skein-repo lore and broken content: a dated pkill incident anecdote, and a
  `--harness explore` instruction naming a harness no registry defines — broken in every
  workspace, including this one.

Workspaces can already choose the review contract (`set-default-review-contract!`, opted
into by `.skein/harnesses.clj`), but the worker contract has no seam: a workspace wanting
its own text can only fight the spool through the SPEC-004.C96 conflict-recording path,
which is a warning mechanism, not configuration. Additionally, this repo's
delegate-pipeline prompts prepend the same contract text that the preamble injects, so
those workers currently receive it twice.

## PROP-Wct-001@2.P2 Goals

- **PROP-Wct-001@2.G1:** Every headless run whose harness enables preambles (`:preamble?`
  true, today's default) always receives the small engine-coupled invariant core, and
  only that core when the workspace configures nothing. `:preamble? false` harnesses and
  interactive sessions keep their shipped semantics.
- **PROP-Wct-001@2.G2:** Workspaces decide the rest of the worker-contract text through
  seams with review-contract-shaped fail-loud semantics, without triggering conflict
  recording.
- **PROP-Wct-001@2.G3:** Task-workflow text (assigned-strand reading, `progress=`,
  `status=implemented`) reaches only serving runs — runs with an outgoing `serves` edge,
  the engine's existing delegation discriminator — and stops being injected into spawns
  that serve nothing.
- **PROP-Wct-001@2.G4:** No shipped preamble text instructs agents to run a command that
  cannot work: the injected contract stops naming any concrete harness, and repo incident
  lore leaves the spool for docs.
- **PROP-Wct-001@2.G5:** This repo's own delegation workflow keeps its current behavior
  (agent-plan `awaiting_verification` flow intact) by opting in through workspace config,
  and its pipeline workers stop receiving the contract twice.

## PROP-Wct-001@2.P3 Non-goals

- **PROP-Wct-001@2.NG1:** No change to the interactive-session preamble or to
  `:preamble? false` harness semantics.
- **PROP-Wct-001@2.NG2:** No change to the review-contract seam beyond serving as the
  pattern to mirror.
- **PROP-Wct-001@2.NG3:** No new persistence: contract text stays weaver-lifetime runtime
  state, per the existing seams' semantics.
- **PROP-Wct-001@2.NG4:** No attempt to make `progress=` programmatically consumed; it
  remains a convention of the delegation task workflow.
- **PROP-Wct-001@2.NG5:** No "read-only harness" capability class: harnesses stay
  undifferentiated replaceable seats ("no harness is home"); read-only-ness remains
  prompt/sandbox discipline owned by workspace registrations.

## PROP-Wct-001@2.P4 Proposed scope

- **PROP-Wct-001@2.S1:** agent-run owns a generic always-on worker core — the
  engine-coupled invariants, with the PID-only rule stated generically — included in
  every preamble-carrying headless run ahead of any workspace-configured text.
- **PROP-Wct-001@2.S2:** The domain model gains two workspace-owned worker-text slots on
  the engine, resolving the ownership question: (i) the existing unconditional
  preamble-extension slot, semantics unchanged (SPEC-004.C96 conflict recording and
  reload tolerance); (ii) a new task-contract slot delivered only to serving runs, with
  "serving" defined by the `serves` relation. Task-scoped delivery must live on the
  engine because only the engine composes per-run preambles; a second data slot is chosen
  over widening the extension seam to function values, keeping workspace config
  data-first (PHILOSOPHY "prose guides, code decides") and the added surface to one
  setter pair (TEN-004).
- **PROP-Wct-001@2.S3:** The task-contract slot mirrors the review-contract setter
  semantics exactly (TEN-003): a non-blank string registers, nil clears back to the
  default of no task text, anything else fails loudly; re-registration replaces without
  conflict recording because the slot is workspace-owned configuration, not a cross-spool
  claim. The engine substitutes the served strand's real id for the `<task-id>`
  placeholder so injected commands are runnable as written.
- **PROP-Wct-001@2.S4:** Delegation stops claiming the extension seam at install and
  instead exports its task-workflow fragment for workspaces to register on the
  task-contract slot. The helper-spawning line is removed from injected contract text
  entirely — the engine's `[agent-run context]` block already documents spawn/await, and
  concrete harness names are workspace data — fixing the broken `--harness explore`
  instruction by removal (with docs examples updated to name only harnesses their
  workspace defines). The pkill anecdote moves to delegation docs; the core keeps the
  generic rule.
- **PROP-Wct-001@2.S5:** This repo's workspace config opts in to the exported
  task-workflow fragment and drops its duplicate pipeline prepend, preserving current
  worker behavior here.
- **PROP-Wct-001@2.S6:** Docs kept in sync: delegation README/cookbook contract text and
  examples, agent-run README, regenerated `*.api.md`. No root-spec delta: SPEC-004.C96
  already states set-once reload semantics generically and the new slot adopts the
  review-contract shape documented at the spool-contract tier.

## PROP-Wct-001@2.P5 Open questions

- **PROP-Wct-001@2.Q1:** None blocking. Naming of the new setter/exports and the exact
  composition order/wiring are plan-level detail (see PLAN-Wct-001).
