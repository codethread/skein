Review PLAN-Pnl-001.PH2 as just implemented (harness default defs in spools/shuttle/src/skein/spools/shuttle.clj register-default-harnesses!, .skein/config.clj :codex, and the test updates in config_test.clj/shuttle_test.clj; PH1 is already reviewed — confine yourself to the PH2 delta plus any PH1-finding remediation the PH2 builder reported). Note tag: [agent-panels/PH2 review].

Check: (1) every resume flag shipped was verified against the installed CLI, not guessed — the builder's final message should say so; spot-check yourself with <tool> --help where available; (2) the R1 fallback taken (if any) is correctly session-persisting-but-:resume-less rather than silently dropped; (3) codex --ephemeral removal side effects considered (session files now accumulate — is that acknowledged in comments/docs stubs); (4) register-default-harnesses! only-if-missing semantics preserved (no clobbering user redefinitions); (5) test assertions match what actually shipped rather than the plan's assumption; (6) PH1-finding remediation done faithfully.

You are a READ-ONLY reviewer (findings-only): do not edit files, mutate strands (notes are allowed — notes are append-only memory, not mutation), close tasks, or commit. Read devflow/feat/agent-panels/agent-panels.plan.md first. Inspect the working tree with git status/git diff plus the files named above. FINDINGS OUTPUT PROTOCOL (contractual — downstream build tasks parse this):
- Your note MUST begin with the exact tag shown above, followed by findings as lines each starting with [P1] (must fix), [P2] (should fix), or [P3] (nit) — or the exact text "No findings." if clean.
- Write the note SHELL-SAFELY — freeform quoting has mangled notes before. Use exactly this pattern:
    note_text=$(cat <<'NOTE'
    <tag> your findings here...
    NOTE
    )
    strand agent note d5af5 "$note_text" --by <your-run-id>
- If you realize a posted note was wrong or mangled, post a full corrected note with the SAME tag; readers take the latest.
- End with the same findings as your final message. Report only actionable correctness, regression, contract, and maintainability risks; say explicitly when a check passed.
- IF BLOCKED: set --attr status=blocked on your task strand with an explanatory note and stop.
