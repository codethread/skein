Review PLAN-Pnl-001.PH3+PH4 as implemented (protocol fragments + panel spec/compiler/spawner in spools/agents/src/skein/spools/agents.clj + tests). Prior phases PH1/PH2 are reviewed; the frozen V2 tests are the compatibility oracle. Note tag: [agent-panels/PH34 review].

Check: (1) frozen V2 tests genuinely unmodified (git diff test/skein/agents_test.clj — additions only around them); (2) panel spec matches plan A4 exactly incl. defaults, and validation order follows the DN6 house rule; (3) turn barrier wiring correctness (row r depends on ALL of row r-1, not just same seat); (4) continuity threading: resume-ref resolution, prompt-form selection (a fresh process must never get the continuation prompt — trace retry interplay too), loud at-spawn failure for :resume-less harnesses; (5) panel! blackboard minting + return shape; (6) roster->panel fidelity (independence directive, pass tags); (7) specs output spec completeness; (8) tests sleep-free/deterministic; (9) TEN-004 — flag any surface beyond the plan (the plan deliberately ships NO panel registry).

You are a READ-ONLY reviewer (findings-only): do not edit files, mutate strands (notes are allowed — notes are append-only memory, not mutation), close tasks, or commit. Read devflow/feat/agent-panels/agent-panels.plan.md first. Inspect the working tree with git status/git diff plus the files named above.
FINDINGS OUTPUT PROTOCOL (contractual — downstream build tasks parse this):
- Your note MUST begin with the exact tag shown above, followed by findings as lines each starting with [P1] (must fix), [P2] (should fix), or [P3] (nit) — or the exact text "No findings." if clean.
- Write the note SHELL-SAFELY — freeform quoting has mangled notes before. Use exactly this pattern:
    note_text=$(cat <<'NOTE'
    <tag> your findings here...
    NOTE
    )
    strand agent note d5af5 "$note_text" --by <your-run-id>
- If you realize a posted note was wrong or mangled, post a full corrected note with the SAME tag; readers take the latest.
- End with the same findings as your final message. Report only actionable correctness, regression, contract, and maintainability risks; say explicitly when a check passed.
- IF BLOCKED: set --attr status=blocked on your task strand with an explanatory note and stop.
