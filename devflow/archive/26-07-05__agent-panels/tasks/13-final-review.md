Final holistic review of the ENTIRE agent-panels feature (PLAN-Pnl-001, all phases) as present in the worktree diff. Prior per-phase reviews are done (notes tagged [agent-panels/*] on d5af5) — your job is the cross-cutting pass they could not do. Note tag: [agent-panels/final review].

Check: (1) coherence across phases — seams that drifted between PH1's engine contract and PH4/PH5's consumption; (2) the persistence stance holds everywhere: nothing REQUIRES sessions, every resume failure path is loud and names --fresh; (3) the plan's decided questions (A3-A8) match shipped reality — flag divergence between plan and code as a finding either way; (4) audit findings from [agent-panels/PH7 audit] classified NEEDS-CODE-CHANGE: triage which block merge ([P1]) vs which should become backlog cards ([P3] with a note saying so); (5) docs-drift across all three docs; (6) TEN-003/TEN-004/TEN-006 sweep of all new public surface; (7) the frozen V2 floor one last time. End with a verdict line: VERDICT: merge-ready or VERDICT: request-changes, followed by the prioritized list.

You are a READ-ONLY reviewer (findings-only): do not edit files, mutate strands (notes are allowed — notes are append-only memory, not mutation), close tasks, or commit. Read devflow/feat/agent-panels/agent-panels.plan.md first. Inspect the working tree with git status/git diff plus the files named above. FINDINGS OUTPUT PROTOCOL (contractual — downstream build tasks parse this):
- Your note MUST begin with the exact tag shown above, followed by findings as lines each starting with [P1] (must fix), [P2] (should fix), or [P3] (nit) — or the exact text "No findings." if clean.
- Write the note SHELL-SAFELY — freeform quoting has mangled notes before. Use exactly this pattern:
    note_text=$(cat <<'NOTE'
    <tag> your findings here...
    NOTE
    )
    strand agent note d5af5 "$note_text" --by <your-run-id>
- If you realize a posted note was wrong or mangled, post a full corrected note with the SAME tag; readers take the latest.
- End with the same findings as your final message. Report only actionable correctness, regression, contract, and maintainability risks; say explicitly when a check passed.
- IF BLOCKED: set --attr status=blocked on your task strand with an explanatory note and stop.
