Review PLAN-Pnl-001.PH1 as just implemented (session continuation in spools/shuttle/src/skein/spools/shuttle.clj + test/skein/shuttle_test.clj; the rest of the tree is prior accepted work — do not re-review it). Note tag: [agent-panels/PH1 review].

Check: (1) no-opt path byte-identical (trace spawn/build-argv for runs without :resume); (2) the failure matrix is complete and loud per plan A1 (missing :resume key, missing session-id, name mismatch, concurrent continuation, interactive) with useful ex-info data; (3) splice ordering (resume args before prompt) and placeholder resolution correctness; (4) provenance attr+edge shape fits existing graph conventions (annotation edge type "resumes"); (5) error-class stamping actually reachable on the paths that matter; (6) tests deterministic/sleep-free and asserting behavior not implementation trivia; (7) defharness! :resume validation quality.

You are a READ-ONLY reviewer (findings-only): do not edit files, mutate strands (notes are allowed — notes are append-only memory, not mutation), close tasks, or commit. Read devflow/feat/agent-panels/agent-panels.plan.md first. Inspect the working tree with git status/git diff plus the files named above. FINDINGS OUTPUT PROTOCOL (contractual — downstream build tasks parse this):
- Your note MUST begin with the exact tag shown above, followed by findings as lines each starting with [P1] (must fix), [P2] (should fix), or [P3] (nit) — or the exact text "No findings." if clean.
- Write the note SHELL-SAFELY — freeform quoting has mangled notes before. Use exactly this pattern:
    note_text=$(cat <<'NOTE'
    <tag> your findings here...
    NOTE
    )
    strand agent note d5af5 "$note_text" --by <your-run-id>
- If you realize a posted note was wrong or mangled, post a full corrected note with the SAME tag; readers take the latest.
- End with the same findings as your final message. Report only actionable correctness, regression, contract, and maintainability risks; say explicitly when a check passed.
- IF BLOCKED: set --attr status=blocked on your task strand with an explanatory note and stop.
