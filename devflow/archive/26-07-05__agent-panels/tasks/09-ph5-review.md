Review PLAN-Pnl-001.PH5 as implemented (review!/council! presets + retry plumbing in agents.clj + tests). Note tag: [agent-panels/PH5 review].

Check: (1) V2 frozen tests untouched by git diff and green; (2) review! preset produces byte-identical prompts/attrs to the pre-preset implementation for roster and non-roster paths (diff the prompt-building paths carefully — this is the highest regression risk of the whole feature); (3) council!: no silent defaults anywhere, poll-loop text gone from every prompt, barriers correct, :seats validation loud, CLI stays scalar-only per TEN-006 with about-doc saying so; (4) retry matrix: preserve-by-default, --fresh severs AND full-brief prompt, resume-classed loud guidance, no retry loop against lost sessions; (5) about-doc accuracy vs behavior; (6) anything in agents.clj now dead (old council prompt fns etc) actually removed, not orphaned.

You are a READ-ONLY reviewer (findings-only): do not edit files, mutate strands (notes are allowed — notes are append-only memory, not mutation), close tasks, or commit. Read devflow/feat/agent-panels/agent-panels.plan.md first. Inspect the working tree with git status/git diff plus the files named above.
FINDINGS OUTPUT PROTOCOL (contractual — downstream build tasks parse this):
- Your note MUST begin with the exact tag shown above, followed by findings as lines each starting with [P1] (must fix), [P2] (should fix), or [P3] (nit) — or the exact text "No findings." if clean.
- Write the note SHELL-SAFELY — freeform quoting has mangled notes before. Use exactly this pattern:
    note_text=$(cat <<'NOTE'
    <tag> your findings here...
    NOTE
    )
    strand agent note d5af5 "$note_text" --by <your-run-id>
- If you realize a posted note was wrong or mangled, post a full corrected note with the SAME tag; readers take the latest.
- End with the same findings as your final message. Report only actionable correctness, regression, contract, and maintainability risks; say explicitly when a check passed.
- IF BLOCKED: set --attr status=blocked on your task strand with an explanatory note and stop.
