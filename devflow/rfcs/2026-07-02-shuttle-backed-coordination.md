# Shuttle-backed Agent Coordination

**Document ID:** `RFC-010`
**Status:** Implemented
**Date:** 2026-07-02
**Related:** [Shuttle spool](../../spools/shuttle/src/skein/spools/shuttle.clj), [Workflow spool](../../src/skein/spools/workflow.md), [Devflow spool](../../src/skein/spools/devflow.md), [Workflow ergonomics archive](../archive/26-07-02__workflow-ergonomics/), [Shuttle spool proposal](../feat/shuttle-spool/proposal.md), [Strand Model](../specs/strand-model.md), [Weaver Runtime](../specs/daemon-runtime.md), [CLI Surface](../specs/cli.md)

## RFC-010.P1 Problem

Dogfooding the `workflow-ergonomics` feature proved that strands are a strong
coordination substrate, but the executable-agent part of the loop is still too
manual. The coordinator had to translate ready strands into harness-native
subagent calls, watch chat/session state, reconcile `/tmp` sentinels with strand
attributes, update task indexes and plan notes by hand, and recover from partial
subagent completion by inspecting diffs and ad hoc progress markers.

The newly landed Shuttle spool supplies the missing executable layer: durable
agent-run strands, readiness-driven spawning, harness selection, run results,
crash reconciliation, and append-only notes. The decision now is how to compose
Shuttle with the existing strand DAG, workflow/devflow stages, and repo-local
`.skein` conventions so future features can delegate work through Skein itself
rather than through a coordinator's private harness session.

Pain points to address:

- **RFC-010.P1.1:** Delegation is not durable enough. A harness subagent call is
  invisible to the graph until it voluntarily writes progress attributes; if the
  coordinator session dies, future agents must recover from a handover file,
  `/tmp` sentinel, chat transcript, or partial diff.
- **RFC-010.P1.2:** Ready work and executable work are separate. `strand ready`
  identifies the next task, but a human/coordinator still chooses a harness,
  writes a prompt, starts the run, waits, and copies the result back.
- **RFC-010.P1.3:** Dependency sequencing is duplicated. The strand DAG knows
  when T4 is unblocked by T3, but the subagent launch happens imperatively after
  the coordinator notices that readiness changed.
- **RFC-010.P1.4:** Fan-out/fan-in review is awkward. Multiple independent
  reviewers can be launched, but their runs, results, and synthesis dependency
  are not graph-native unless the coordinator manually creates that structure.
- **RFC-010.P1.5:** Long-running or restarted agents lack durable memory.
  Handover files and progress attrs help, but they are not a standard append-only
  per-run memory channel available to respawned successors.
- **RFC-010.P1.6:** Workflow steps can describe agent work, but cannot yet ask
  the Shuttle to fulfill that work as a first-class gate and record which harness
  closed it.
- **RFC-010.P1.7:** Repo guidance now describes delegated-agent etiquette, but
  the system does not yet encode it into a spawn contract, prompt preamble, or
  queryable run/result shape.

## RFC-010.P2 Goals

- **RFC-010.G1:** Make delegated agent execution durable and observable by
  representing each run as a Shuttle strand linked to the task/workflow strand it
  serves.
- **RFC-010.G2:** Preserve the existing separation of concerns: strands model
  work and dependencies; workflow/devflow model lifecycle; Shuttle executes
  agent runs; repo `.skein` config composes them into local conventions.
- **RFC-010.G3:** Use `depends-on` readiness as the only sequencing primitive for
  agent execution. A run starts when its blockers close; fan-out/fan-in is graph
  structure, not coordinator code.
- **RFC-010.G4:** Let coordinators and future agents inspect delegation through
  `strand show`, `strand ready --query work`, `strand op agent ps`,
  `strand op agent await`, run attributes, and Shuttle notes.
- **RFC-010.G5:** Encode the delegated-agent contract in generated prompts and
  graph links: read assigned context, record progress, set result/status, never
  close coordinator-owned task strands unless explicitly delegated.
- **RFC-010.G6:** Support harness choice as data (`pi`, Claude Code, aliases such
  as `reviewer` or `implementer`) without changing workflow/devflow contracts.
- **RFC-010.G7:** Provide a path for workflow `:gate` or step metadata to spawn a
  Shuttle run and close/annotate the workflow step when the run succeeds.
- **RFC-010.G8:** Keep the public CLI thin. New behavior should be trusted
  repo-local ops/patterns or Shuttle's existing `strand op agent` surface, not a
  broad new core command set.

## RFC-010.P3 Non-goals

- **RFC-010.NG1:** Do not replace human/coordinator judgment. HITL checkpoints,
  final validation, merge/archive decisions, and policy exceptions remain owned
  by the coordinator/user.
- **RFC-010.NG2:** Do not add a new scheduler, lease system, job queue, or core
  worker primitive. Shuttle already uses event handling plus strand readiness.
- **RFC-010.NG3:** Do not make agents untrusted or sandboxed. Harness processes
  still run with user-approved authority per TEN-002.
- **RFC-010.NG4:** Do not require all task strands to auto-spawn. Some work must
  remain manual, HITL, or coordinator-owned.
- **RFC-010.NG5:** Do not make workflow/devflow depend directly on Shuttle.
  Integration should happen by shared attributes and repo/userland config so the
  spools remain independently useful.
- **RFC-010.NG6:** Do not make Shuttle results authoritative proof of correctness.
  A successful run is evidence for the coordinator; tests, review, and explicit
  strand closure still determine completion.

## RFC-010.P4 Options

| ID | Summary | Pros | Cons |
| -- | ------- | ---- | ---- |
| RFC-010.O1 | Keep using harness-native subagents and only document better etiquette. | No implementation work; keeps coordination flexible. | Leaves delegation invisible, non-durable, non-queryable, and hard to resume; repeats the exact workflow-ergonomics pain. |
| RFC-010.O2 | Use Shuttle manually via `strand op agent spawn` whenever a coordinator wants a subagent. | Immediate value; run state/result become durable; no additional abstraction required. | Still leaves prompt construction, parent links, depends-on wiring, and status conventions to each coordinator. |
| RFC-010.O3 | Add repo-local patterns/ops that create task-linked Shuttle runs from ready work. | Encodes local delegation conventions; keeps core and spools small; makes most agent delegation graph-native while preserving manual opt-in. | Repo-specific surface must be maintained; prompt templates can drift from the root `AGENTS.md` coordination section; still needs coordinator verification/closure. |
| RFC-010.O4 | Add a generic Shuttle/workflow bridge that fulfills workflow gates automatically based on step attributes. | Most seamless for lifecycle workflows; a workflow step can declare an agent gate and let the graph execute it. | Higher coupling risk; needs careful idempotency and failure semantics; premature if manual/pattern delegation has not settled. |
| RFC-010.O5 | Build a full autonomous coordinator that watches all ready work, chooses harnesses, spawns agents, validates, closes tasks, and advances devflow. | Maximally automated. | Too much policy in one system; likely violates TEN-004/TEN-006; hard to debug and unsafe around HITL/final validation boundaries. |

## RFC-010.P5 Recommendation

- **RFC-010.REC1:** Choose an incremental combination of **RFC-010.O2** and
  **RFC-010.O3**, with **RFC-010.O4** as a follow-up once conventions prove out.
  First make Shuttle the blessed execution substrate for delegated agent work,
  then add small repo-local helpers that produce the right graph shape and prompt
  preamble.
- **RFC-010.REC2:** The initial graph shape should be:
  - a normal task/review/workflow step strand remains the coordination item;
  - a Shuttle run strand is created with `parent-of` from the coordination item
    and `shuttle/spawned-by` pointing at the coordinator/run when known;
  - the run may depend on the same blockers as the task, or downstream collector
    runs may depend on child run ids for fan-in;
  - the run closes itself on harness success, carrying `shuttle/result`; the
    coordination item remains active until the coordinator verifies and closes it.
- **RFC-010.REC3:** Add one repo-local delegated-run pattern or op, tentatively
  `agent-delegate`, that accepts `{task, harness, prompt/body?, cwd?,
  max-attempts?, spawned-by?}` and creates the Shuttle run with the standard
  prompt preamble. It should fail loudly if the task id is missing, not active,
  or lacks enough body/context for delegation.
- **RFC-010.REC4:** Extend `agent-plan` only after the standalone helper proves
  useful. A later `agent-plan` input could mark a task as auto-delegated with a
  harness alias, but the initial helper should work for any existing strand.
- **RFC-010.REC5:** Standardize prompt preamble content in repo config rather
  than relying on each coordinator: read assigned strand, obey project rules,
  use disposable workspaces for live experiments, update progress attributes or
  Shuttle notes, set `status=implemented` only when ready for coordinator
  verification, do not close sibling/parent strands, do not commit unless asked.
- **RFC-010.REC6:** Use Shuttle notes for durable run memory and handover. Agents
  should append important discoveries to their run strand or assigned task
  strand before risky transitions; future respawns/follow-ups read notes before
  continuing.
- **RFC-010.REC7:** Keep final task closure and devflow advancement
  coordinator-owned. Shuttle run success may unblock a synthesis/review run, but
  should not by itself mark a task done until validation policy is explicitly
  encoded for that task type.
- **RFC-010.REC8:** After delegated-run helpers are stable, design the workflow
  gate bridge as a small userland adapter: a step/checkpoint carrying
  `workflow/gate "subagent"` plus `shuttle/*` request attributes spawns a run;
  on successful run closure, the adapter records the closing harness/result on
  the workflow step and advances/validates according to explicit policy.

## RFC-010.P6 Consequences

- **RFC-010.C1:** `.skein/init.clj` and `.skein/spools.edn` should approve and
  activate `spools/shuttle` in the canonical repo workspace when the user accepts
  this direction.
- **RFC-010.C2:** `.skein/config.clj` likely gains one small delegation helper
  (pattern or op), plus query/view conventions for task-linked Shuttle runs and
  active/failed delegated work.
- **RFC-010.C3:** the root `AGENTS.md` "Repo coordination workspace" section (formerly `.skein/AGENTS.md`) and the local strand skill should teach the
  new default delegation loop: inspect ready work, delegate with Shuttle when
  appropriate, monitor `agent ps`/run strands, verify result, then close the
  coordination strand.
- **RFC-010.C4:** Existing devflow finish/validation remains manual, but task
  execution slices can be represented by Shuttle runs instead of private harness
  sessions.
- **RFC-010.C5:** Tests for repo config should cover: helper registration, bad
  task ids failing loudly, graph links between task and run, generated prompt
  containing the delegated-agent contract, run dependency wiring, and queries
  surfacing failed/active runs.
- **RFC-010.C6:** Shuttle's own contract should not gain repo-specific concepts
  such as devflow task keys. Repo config translates local conventions into
  Shuttle's generic run attributes.
- **RFC-010.C7:** Workflow gate integration, if pursued, needs its own feature
  proposal/spec delta because it changes how `workflow/gate` is interpreted by
  this repo's runtime configuration.
- **RFC-010.C8:** The system should document failure semantics plainly: a failed
  or exhausted Shuttle run stays visible and blocks dependents; a coordinator can
  inspect, kill, respawn, supersede, or mark the assigned task blocked.

## RFC-010.P7 Likely user-facing shape

Manual delegation should work with today's Shuttle surface:

```sh
strand op agent spawn \
  --harness pi \
  --title "Implement userland surface" \
  --parent <task-id> \
  --cwd /path/to/worktree \
  --prompt "<standard delegated-agent preamble + task body>"

strand op agent ps --active
strand op agent await <run-id> --timeout-secs 900
strand show <run-id> | jq
strand op agent notes <run-id>
```

A repo-local helper should compress that to something like:

```sh
strand op agent-delegate <task-id> --harness pi --cwd /path/to/worktree
```

or, if a pattern is preferable:

```sh
printf '%s' '{"task":"<task-id>","harness":"pi","cwd":"/path/to/worktree"}' \
  | strand weave --pattern agent-delegate
```

Fan-out/fan-in should be graph-native:

```sh
r1=$(strand op agent-delegate <review-task> --harness pi --prompt-key workflow-review | jq -r .run.id)
r2=$(strand op agent-delegate <review-task> --harness claude --prompt-key config-review | jq -r .run.id)
strand op agent spawn --harness claude --depends-on "$r1" --depends-on "$r2" \
  --parent <review-task> --prompt "Read child run results and synthesize findings."
```

## RFC-010.P8 Follow-up tracking

Most implementation questions were resolved by the archived Shuttle, treadle, `agent-delegate`, and `afk-gates` features. Remaining follow-up work is tracked in [`../../BACKLOG.md`](../../BACKLOG.md). This RFC remains the design rationale; the backlog is the canonical home for pending work items.

## RFC-010.P9 Outcome

- **RFC-010.OUT1:** Accepted in part. Pending follow-up work has been moved to [`../../BACKLOG.md`](../../BACKLOG.md).
- **RFC-010.OUT2 (2026-07-02):** Accepted in part and dogfooded. Shuttle is
  activated in the canonical repo workspace (C1), and the REC8 workflow gate
  bridge shipped as the `skein.spools.treadle` spool
  ([feature folder](../archive/26-07-02__treadle/proposal.md), contract in
  `spools/shuttle/treadle.md`) — built, reviewed, and fixed entirely through
  Shuttle-delegated agent runs coordinated over strands. Q2 and Q7 are
  resolved by the treadle design (spawn only at gate readiness; the contract
  is `workflow/gate "subagent"` plus `shuttle/*` request attributes). One REC2
  refinement: inside workflow molecules the run is linked to its gate by a
  `delegates` annotation edge, not `parent-of`, which would surface the run as
  workflow work.
- **RFC-010.OUT3 (2026-07-02):** Implemented follow-up slices archived:
  `agent-delegate` shipped the repo-local helper for plain task strands
  ([feature folder](../archive/26-07-02__agent-delegate/proposal.md)), and
  `afk-gates` shipped delegated Devflow AFK task execution via subagent gates
  ([feature folder](../archive/26-07-02__afk-gates/proposal.md)). Broader
  composition and attention gaps moved into RFC-011/RFC-013 and were archived
  with their own implementation reviews.
