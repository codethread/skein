# Feature Tracking Registry

**Document ID:** `RFC-014`
**Status:** Open
**Date:** 2026-07-02
**Related:** [RFC-011](./2026-07-02-coordination-attention-surface.md) (attention surface for workflow runs), [Workflow spool](../../spools/workflow.md), [Devflow spool](../../spools/devflow.md), weaver-guild feature (`devflow/feat/weaver-guild/proposal.md` on branch `weaver-guild`; cross-weaver tie-in), [strand skill](../../.agents/skills/strand/SKILL.md)

## RFC-014.P1 Problem

"What is in flight in this repo right now?" has no single answer. The strand
graph answers it only for work that happens to be strand-tracked — devflow
molecules, `agent-plan` DAGs, delegate pipelines. Work driven by other
implementations is invisible: file-based AFK task queues
(`devflow/feat/*/tasks/index.yml`), ad hoc agent sessions, and humans editing
directly.

Concrete incident (2026-07-02): two agent sessions shared this checkout. One
had to fall back to polling `git status` and file mtimes to detect that the
other was mid-flight on the namespace-tier docs sweep, because that session
had no strand presence — `strand ready --query work`, `workflow-runs`, and
`flow-await` could say nothing about it. Meanwhile the weaver-guild AFK loop
(file-based queue in a worktree) was equally invisible to everyone else until
a marker strand was hand-authored after the fact. The coordination surface
exists (RFC-011: `flow-await`, `flow-status`, `stalled-gates`) but only for
runs that live in the graph.

The cost is real: sessions can't gate merges on each other, can't discover
each other's worktrees/branches, and re-derive state from filesystem
side effects.

## RFC-014.P2 Goals

- **RFC-014.G1:** One query answers "which features are in flight, who is
  driving each, and where (worktree/branch)" regardless of workflow
  implementation.
- **RFC-014.G2:** The answer is awaitable: a coordinator can block until a
  feature (or the whole repo) quiesces, mirroring `flow-await`.
- **RFC-014.G3:** Near-zero ceremony. Strand-tracked flows should get
  registry presence for free; everything else should need one registration
  call plus normal completion, with ongoing liveness derived rather than
  manually maintained wherever possible.
- **RFC-014.G4:** Staleness is visible, not silent: an entry whose driver
  died reads as stale, never as "quiet" (TEN-003).

## RFC-014.P3 Non-goals

- **RFC-014.NG1:** Replacing or constraining any workflow engine; the
  registry describes work, it does not run it.
- **RFC-014.NG2:** Enforcement. Untracked work stays possible (TEN-002);
  the registry is a convention with good ergonomics, not a gate.
- **RFC-014.NG3:** Cross-machine visibility. That is the weaver-guild
  peering feature; this RFC only defines what one weaver would *answer*
  when a peer asks (see RFC-014.C3).

## RFC-014.P4 Options

### RFC-014.O1 Convention only

Document a marker-strand convention in the strand skill and `AGENTS.md`:
every session/feature creates one strand
(`feature=<slug>`, `owner`, `worktree`, `branch`, body describing the work)
and closes it on merge/abandon. The existing `feature-active`/`work` queries
already surface it.

- Pros: zero code; works today (the weaver-guild marker strand `y9z8t` is
  exactly this).
- Cons: unenforced and forgettable — today's incident happened *with* the
  skill loaded; no await semantics; no staleness story; every attribute name
  is ad hoc.

### RFC-014.O2 Repo-local init.clj ops

Extend this repo's `.skein/init.clj` conventions (the `devflow-*`/`flow-*`
op family) with `feature-track`, `feature-finish`, a `features` query, and a
`feature-await` op wrapping the marker-strand convention.

- Pros: fits the existing repo-conventions surface (`devflow-conventions`
  already indexes ops/queries); scriptable from any harness.
- Cons: skein-src-only — every repo reinvents it; still fully opt-in for
  non-strand flows; vocabulary stays unshared so tooling can't rely on it.

### RFC-014.O3 Shared roster spool

Ship a small `skein.spools.roster` on the classpath beside
workflow/devflow: a tiny attribute vocabulary (`roster/feature`,
`roster/owner`, `roster/worktree`, `roster/branch`, `roster/engine`,
`roster/heartbeat`) plus helpers — `track!`, `finish!`,
`roster` (query), `await-quiet!` (block until no active, non-stale entries
for a scope). An event-handler adapter stamps roster attributes onto
workflow/devflow roots from their existing `family`/`feature` attributes, so
strand-tracked flows register for free; file-based loops and ad hoc sessions
make one `track!` call (or `strand op` equivalent registered by the spool).
Liveness is derived, not manually maintained: any graph mutation by the
tracked driver counts as a heartbeat, and an explicit `heartbeat!` exists
only for engines that never touch the graph between registration and finish
(the honest cost for those engines is periodic touches, acknowledged in C1).

- Pros: consistent vocabulary everywhere; awaitable (G2); free for
  strand-tracked flows (G3); staleness explicit via heartbeat (G4); and the
  natural cross-repo answer — once weaver-guild peering ships, "what are you
  working on" is just this roster served over a guild op.
- Cons: another shipped spool to maintain; heartbeat/staleness semantics
  need care to stay fail-loud without being noisy; harnesses (AFK loop
  scripts) need one integration call each.

## RFC-014.P5 Recommendation

- **RFC-014.REC1:** Adopt **O1 immediately** as written convention in the
  strand skill and `AGENTS.md` (it is the interim behavior and costs
  nothing), and build **O3** as the durable answer. O2 is subsumed: the
  roster spool registers its op/query under the same repo-conventions
  surface, so `devflow-conventions` indexes it like everything else.
- **RFC-014.REC2:** Auto-derivation first: the adapter for workflow/devflow
  roots ships with the spool so the majority of tracked work needs nothing.
  Explicit `track!` is only for engines the graph cannot see.
- **RFC-014.REC3:** `await-quiet!` mirrors `flow-await`'s shape
  (`{:reason :quiet|:stale|:timeout :entries [...]}`) so coordinators learn
  one idiom for both "this run needs me" and "this repo is calm enough to
  merge".

## RFC-014.P6 Consequences

- **RFC-014.C1:** Harness touchpoints: the devflow AFK loop scripts call
  `track!`/`finish!` (or the spool's op) at loop start/end; interactive
  sessions get the convention from the strand skill. Engines that never
  mutate the graph mid-run additionally need periodic `heartbeat!` touches
  (e.g. per task-cycle in the AFK loop) or their entries will read stale —
  more than one call, and the RFC accepts that cost for those engines.
- **RFC-014.C2:** Merge gating becomes graph-native: "can I merge?" is
  `await-quiet!` scoped to main-checkout entries instead of polling
  `git status`.
- **RFC-014.C3:** Weaver-guild tie-in: a peering repo's `guild.describe`
  (or a sibling `guild.roster` op) can serve roster entries, giving manager
  weavers a uniform in-flight view across repos without new state.
- **RFC-014.C4:** Staleness policy needs one decision: heartbeat via
  periodic `heartbeat!` touches with a threshold, surfaced as `:stale` —
  never auto-burned (TEN-003; cleanup stays a deliberate act).

## RFC-014.P7 Open questions

- **RFC-014.Q1:** Heartbeat mechanism and threshold: explicit `heartbeat!`
  calls vs deriving liveness from `updated_at` of the driver's recent
  mutations; what gap reads as stale.
- **RFC-014.Q2:** Lifecycle of finished entries: close (durable history) vs
  wisp/burn (`skein.spools.ephemeral` style) vs digest on archive.
- **RFC-014.Q3:** Should `roster/engine` name the implementation
  (`devflow-molecule`, `file-queue`, `human`) for tooling to branch on, or
  stay freeform?

## RFC-014.P8 Outcome

Pending decision.
