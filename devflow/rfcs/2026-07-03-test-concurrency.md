# Test Concurrency and Multi-Runtime JVM Support

**Document ID:** `RFC-016` **Status:** Implemented **Date:** 2026-07-03 **Related:** [Weaver Runtime](../specs/daemon-runtime.md), [REPL API](../specs/repl-api.md), [Library Author Testing RFC](../archive/26-07-03__library-author-testing-support/rfcs/2026-06-26-library-author-testing.md), [Library Author Testing feature](../archive/26-07-03__library-author-testing-support/proposal.md), [Shuttle spool](../../spools/shuttle/README.md), [Chime spool](../../spools/chime/README.md)

## RFC-016.P1 Problem

`clojure -M:test` runs 333 tests / 1796 assertions strictly sequentially (~34s wall on the reference machine, ~131% CPU). Every weaver-backed test pays full runtime start/stop serially. This slows all validation loops (agent delegation gates included), and the underlying constraint — **one weaver runtime per JVM** — also blocks `library-author-testing-support`: a `skein.test.alpha/with-weaver-world` helper cannot be safely nested or parallelized while `runtime/start!` throws when any runtime is already active.

Verified current state (2026-07-03):

- **RFC-016.P1.1:** `skein.core.weaver.runtime/current-runtime` is a process
  singleton. `start!` fails loudly if it is set; `stop!` clears it; `-main`
  spins on it.
- **RFC-016.P1.2:** The runtime itself is already a self-contained map — every
  registry (`:query-registry`, `:view-registry`, `:pattern-registry`,
  `:op-registry`, `:hook-registry`, event system, spool classloader,
  datasource) is per-runtime state. The `skein.api.*.alpha` layer already takes
  explicit `runtime` as first argument throughout. The singleton is a guard and
  an ambient selector, not a structural necessity.
- **RFC-016.P1.3:** Ambient consumers of the singleton:
  - `skein.api.current.alpha/runtime` (blessed facade for trusted in-process
    config/spool/REPL code, e.g. `init.clj` startup files).
  - `skein.core.client` nREPL eval forms, which deref
    `@skein.core.weaver.runtime/current-runtime` **inside the weaver process**
    to resolve the runtime serving that nREPL server.
  - `skein.repl` fallback routing and `skein.spools.shuttle`'s private
    `(rt)` helper (`*runtime*` binding, else `current/runtime`).
- **RFC-016.P1.4:** Several spools hold JVM-global mutable state independent of
  any runtime: shuttle (`harness-registry`, `in-flight`,
  `preamble-extension`, reconcile state), chime (`notifier-binding`,
  `rule-registry`, `seen-notifications`, `failure-log`, `scanned-batch-ids`),
  guild (`guild-ops`, `deprecated-ops`, `fallback-guild-name`), treadle
  (`scan-monitor`). Parallel tests would race on these even with independent
  runtimes.
- **RFC-016.P1.5:** `clojure.repl.deps/add-libs` (spool sync of approved local
  roots) mutates JVM-global classpath/basis state. `skein.test-runner` already
  documents a hard ordering dependency: `skein.shuttle-test` must precede other
  spool suites or later syncs are poisoned.
- **RFC-016.P1.6:** `skein.repl` keeps ambient connection state
  (`active-config-dir`, `active-state-dir`) by design — it is the human
  interactive surface. Four test namespaces use `with-redefs`
  (`repl-test`, `alpha-test`, `core.client-test`, `spools.workflow-test`),
  which is JVM-global.
- **RFC-016.P1.7:** `skein.test-runner/-main` is a single sequential
  `clojure.test/run-tests` call over all 22 namespaces.

## RFC-016.P2 Goals

- **RFC-016.G1:** Multiple independent weaver runtimes may run concurrently in
  one JVM, each fully isolated (storage, registries, transports, events).
- **RFC-016.G2:** Preserve current daemon semantics: a real weaver process
  still has exactly one published ambient runtime, `skein.api.current.alpha`
  and trusted startup config keep working unchanged, and publishing a second
  runtime in one process still fails loudly.
- **RFC-016.G3:** Spool state (shuttle, chime, guild, treadle) becomes
  runtime-owned so independent runtimes do not share or reset each other's
  registries.
- **RFC-016.G4:** `clojure -M:test` runs parallel-safe namespaces concurrently
  and keeps a documented serialized island for JVM-global concerns
  (`add-libs`, `with-redefs`, ambient REPL connection state), with correct
  aggregate failure reporting and non-interleaved output.
- **RFC-016.G5:** Directly unblock `skein.test.alpha` (LAT feature): weaver
  world fixtures become nestable and parallelizable.

## RFC-016.P3 Non-goals

- **RFC-016.NG1:** No change to the one-weaver-per-workspace model, mill
  supervision, metadata/socket discovery, or the CLI surface.
- **RFC-016.NG2:** No attempt to make `add-libs`-dependent tests parallel;
  they remain a serialized island by design.
- **RFC-016.NG3:** ~~No process-level test sharding (separate JVMs); in-JVM
  concurrency is the target since JVM startup dominates the floor.~~
  *Amended 2026-07-03 by owner decision: concurrent subprocess JVM shards are
  the sanctioned mechanism for the add-libs island specifically. add-libs
  mutates JVM-global tools.deps state by design, so per-shard pristine bases
  are a better model than one serialized chain (ordering and basis-poisoning
  constraints become shard-local), and the boot cost is an accepted trade.
  In-JVM concurrency remains the mechanism for everything else.*
- **RFC-016.NG4:** No redesign of `skein.repl`'s ambient human-facing
  connection state; its tests stay in the serialized island.

## RFC-016.P4 Design

### RFC-016.D1 Publication-explicit runtime lifecycle (feature: multi-runtime-jvm)

Split "a runtime exists in this JVM" from "this process's ambient runtime":

- **RFC-016.D1.1:** `start!` gains a `:publish?` option (default `true`,
  preserving daemon and mill behavior). Publishing when another published
  runtime exists fails loudly exactly as today. `:publish? false` starts an
  unpublished runtime; any number may coexist.
- **RFC-016.D1.2:** `skein.api.current.alpha/runtime` resolves, in order: a
  dynamic per-thread runtime binding, then the published runtime, then fails
  loudly. `start!` binds the dynamic binding around startup-file loading and
  built-in op registration so trusted `init.clj` config works identically for
  unpublished runtimes.
- **RFC-016.D1.3:** nREPL runtime identity must not go through the global
  atom: each runtime's nREPL server resolves back to its own runtime (e.g. a
  server/port→runtime registry or injected middleware — implementer's choice,
  but `skein.core.client` eval forms must stop dereferencing
  `current-runtime` directly so client tests against unpublished runtimes are
  correct).
- **RFC-016.D1.4:** `stop!` unpublishes only if it owns publication;
  unpublished runtime stop is side-effect-free on ambient state.

### RFC-016.D2 Runtime-owned spool state (feature: runtime-owned-spool-state)

- **RFC-016.D2.1:** The runtime map grows a generic `:spool-state` slot
  (atom of spool-keyed state), with a small blessed accessor in
  `skein.api.runtime.alpha` so spools do not reach into runtime internals.
- **RFC-016.D2.2:** Shuttle, chime, guild, and treadle move their module-level
  atoms/monitors into runtime-owned state and take/resolve the runtime
  explicitly (shuttle's `*runtime*`/`(rt)` pattern generalizes via D1.2's
  binding).
- **RFC-016.D2.3:** Spool test suites drop cross-test `reset!` fixtures in
  favor of fresh per-test runtimes where cheap.

### RFC-016.D3 Grouped concurrent test runner (feature: parallel-test-runner)

- **RFC-016.D3.1:** `skein.test-runner` declares two explicit vectors:
  `parallel-namespaces` and `serial-namespaces`, with a comment stating why
  each serial member is serial. Initial serial island: `runtime-deps-test`,
  `shuttle-test`, `config-test` (add-libs, with documented shuttle-first
  ordering), `repl-test` (ambient connection + with-redefs), `alpha-test`,
  `core.client-test`, `spools.workflow-test` (with-redefs; may graduate to
  parallel if their with-redefs use is removed).
- **RFC-016.D3.2:** Parallel namespaces run one-per-thread over a bounded
  pool, each with its own `binding` of clojure.test report state and captured
  output, results aggregated into one summary; any failure/error exits
  non-zero. Serial island runs after (or before) the parallel batch, never
  overlapped.
- **RFC-016.D3.3:** Test hygiene in the same feature: namespace-level shared
  atoms in tests become per-test locals/fixtures; tests must not depend on
  cross-namespace ordering except inside the documented serial island.

## RFC-016.P5 Alternatives considered

- **RFC-016.A1: Process-level sharding (multiple JVMs).** Rejected: pays JVM
  startup per shard (~5s+ each), complicates failure aggregation, and does
  nothing for the LAT blocker (multi-runtime in one JVM).
- **RFC-016.A2: Parallelize `deftest`s within namespaces.** Rejected for now:
  most value is across namespaces; per-test parallelism multiplies hazard
  surface for little extra gain.
- **RFC-016.A3: Remove `current-runtime` entirely.** Rejected: the daemon
  process legitimately has one ambient runtime; trusted config, `skein.repl`
  fallback, and spool ergonomics rely on it. Publication-explicit keeps that
  contract while unblocking tests.

## RFC-016.P6 Staging

Three features, strictly sequenced:

1. `multi-runtime-jvm` (D1) — core unlock; updates `daemon-runtime` spec.
2. `runtime-owned-spool-state` (D2) — depends on D1's binding/`:spool-state`
   decisions; updates spool contract docs.
3. `parallel-test-runner` (D3) — depends on D1+D2; runner + test hygiene.

Success criteria: full suite green under the concurrent runner with a meaningful wall-clock reduction from the 34s baseline; `-M:smoke` unchanged; a follow-up LAT task can start two weaver worlds in one test JVM.

## RFC-016.P7 Observed pre-existing flakes (2026-07-03 session evidence)

A 2026-07-03 session surfaced three tests that pass solo and on rerun but flap under full-suite parallel load. These are not regressions from this RFC's work; they were reproduced on unmodified `main`, and they matter here because the concurrent runner (D3) turns latent async-timing assumptions into real races. The parallel runner **must not** be declared green while these still flap. Line numbers drifted since first observation, so tests are cited by name.

- **RFC-016.P7.1 — `chime-test/notifier-binding-and-manual-notify`
  (`test/skein/chime_test.clj`).** The `notify!` assertions await only the
  `TITLE=` line via `eventually`, then assert the `BODY=` line with a plain
  `is`. Under load the notifier subprocess has written the title but not yet the
  body when the second assertion fires. A per-test fix is to await the body line
  the same way (`eventually #(file-contains? out-file "BODY=Body text")`) before
  asserting, or await notifier-process quiescence.
- **RFC-016.P7.2 — `shuttle-test/reap-manual-leaves-the-session-to-the-human`
  (`test/skein/shuttle_test.clj`).** This unit test runs against the in-file
  `fake-mux` backend (`spawn-interactive!` hardcodes `:backend :fake-mux`, a
  plain detached process; real tmux is exercised by smoke, not here), so the
  race is backend-agnostic: a `:reap :manual` run is expected to leave its
  interactive session's detached process alive for the human after the target
  closes, but the `(is (process-alive? pid))` assertion races the
  spawn/detach/reap liveness transition under load. Needs the same
  session-liveness settling the runner-level concurrency work will have to
  provide, or a per-test wait keyed on the detached process's own state rather
  than wall-clock ordering.
- **RFC-016.P7.3 — `weaver-test/weaver-apply-batch-emits-batch-event-before-compatibility-fanout`
  (`test/skein/weaver_test.clj`) — cheap targeted per-test fix candidate,
  independent of D3.** The test creates its fixture strands with `api/add`,
  then `reset!`s the capture vector, then registers the `:capture` event
  handler — so the handler is registered *after* the fixture `:strand/added`
  events are emitted. Under load a queued fixture `:strand/added` event is
  delivered after registration and shifts the expected event vector by one,
  cascading 1–18 assertion failures depending on timing. The fix is entirely
  local to the test and does not depend on any runner-level concurrency work:
  register the capture handler *before* creating the fixture strands, or drain /
  await event-system quiescence after the fixtures and before `reset!`+register,
  so no fixture event can leak into the captured stream. Worth landing on its
  own regardless of D3's schedule. When D3.3 (test hygiene) lands, fold P7.1 and
  P7.2 in the same pass; P7.3 need not wait for it.
