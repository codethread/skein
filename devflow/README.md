# Devflow

Active feature work is tracked on the kanban board and as devflow workflow runs in the repo `.skein` coordination world. Root specs in `devflow/specs/` become canonical only when feature work ships.

Always study [TENETS](./TENETS.md) and [PHILOSOPHY](./PHILOSOPHY.md). No code, spec or idea can violate these unless explicitly stated and cited in an agreed RFC first.

[RFCs](./rfcs/) propose work that then ships; [ADRs](./adrs/) record a decision reached, including a decision to keep a tenet and *not* build something.

## Root specs

Root specs are canonical for shipped behavior:

- [Strand Model](./specs/strand-model.md) — strand records, state lifecycle, burn deletion, JSON attributes, relation semantics, and readiness rules.
- [CLI Surface](./specs/cli.md) — the op-only public CLI: the `strand` invoke-envelope dispatcher (zero builtin subcommands), the `mill` router/bootstrap/lifecycle surface, and NDJSON single/stream response relay; per-command behavior lives in `spools/batteries.md`.
- [REPL API](./specs/repl-api.md) — interactive Clojure helper contract, including recursive arg-spec and return trees, connected REPL, runtime spool workspace helpers, lifecycle hook helpers, and the `skein.test.alpha` author-side weaver-world test helpers.
- [Weaver Runtime](./specs/daemon-runtime.md) — local long-lived weaver lifecycle, storage model with schema generations and the forward-migration contract, leaf-resolved operation metadata and hook gates, transports, trusted startup config, query registry, the three-kind runtime spool workspace model, and synchronous lifecycle hooks.
- [Alpha Surface](./specs/alpha-surface.md) — the contract index drawing the line around shipped alpha surface: which tiers are in-contract (root specs, blessed API namespaces, opt-in reference spool docs) and which surface is explicitly internal (mill socket protocol, unenumerated error codes, `skein.core.*`).

## Active features

`devflow/feat/` holds only planned-but-unbuilt work; a feature folder appears here when planning starts and moves to `archive/` once its spec deltas merge into the root specs. In-flight work lives on the kanban board and as devflow runs in `.skein`.

- `source-root-spools` — adds `:skein/source-root` as the non-acquiring coordinate for spools shipped in the Skein checkout and moves batteries from the production classpath to the ordinary approved-spool path. Contracts are promoted into `cli.md` (SPEC-002.C14a), `repl-api.md` (SPEC-003.C62-adjacent module guidance and C63), `daemon-runtime.md` (SPEC-004.C42/C44/C48@2/C49@2/C50a/C50b/C94a), and `alpha-surface.md` (SPEC-005.C3); awaiting acceptance and archive.

## Archived features

Archived feature folders preserve historical planning context. Current shipped contracts are the root specs above, even if older archive notes describe pre-spec documentation locations.
Default `rg` searches skip `archive/`; use `rg --no-ignore devflow/archive` when you need those records.

- `26-07-03__spool-git-distribution` — shipped registry-free git spool distribution (RFC-017): sha-pinned `:git` coordinates in `spools.edn`, content-addressed fetch cache with verified tag labels, and explicit activation. Its original optional metadata-file gating was superseded by the Maven-only spool contract.
- `26-07-04__op-only-cli` — shipped RFC-019: removed all builtin strand commands and the `op` prefix; `strand` became a pure invoke-envelope dispatcher with named payloads and stream relay, `mill` absorbed init/weaver lifecycle/repl, the shipped command surface moved to the `skein.spools.batteries` spool over the new blessed `skein.api.cli.alpha` parser, and the socket collapsed to `invoke` + minimal `status` with op-metadata deadlines and hook gating.
- `26-07-04__spool-contract` — shipped the minimal spool contract: retired the `spool.edn` manifest (README dependency information and activation snippets replaced it; RFC-018 was rejected as mooted), made required activation fail loudly on unavailable roots, and allowed uniform Maven-only spool `deps.edn :deps` resolved during acquisition.

- `26-07-05__op-help-convention` — shipped the op help invocation convention: `<op> help|-h|--help` alias for subcommand-declaring ops resolved before hook gating, reserved help tokens, byte-faithful CLI JSON (stdout + stderr details), and the kanban op migrated to declared `:subcommands`.
- `26-07-05__argspec-subcommands` — shipped declarative `:subcommands` in the blessed arg-spec DSL: parser-owned routing with loud missing/unknown errors, registration-time structural validation, `strand help <op>` subcommand rendering, and batteries `query`/`pattern` migrated off the fake subcommand positional.
- `26-07-05__agent-panels` — shipped shuttle session continuation (`:resume` harness splice over captured session ids, `retry --fresh`, persistence-friendly harness defaults that never require persistence) and the panel primitive (seats × blackboard × turn wiring × synthesis compiled from spec'd data; turn-as-run barriers), with `review!`/`council!` as presets — cross-vendor councils, per-seat continuity, poll-loop prompts deleted.
- `26-07-05__weaver-scheduler` — shipped the weaver-owned scheduler primitive: durable `wake-at` records in dedicated SQLite tables, startup/reload re-arming, fully-qualified-symbol handler resolution, at-least-once serialized async dispatch, and data-first introspection.

- `26-07-06__fix-land-signoff-details` — shipped land sign-off input discoverability (SPEC-002.C39a): reviewers see what a sign-off decision needs before deciding.

- `26-07-10__vocab-registry` — shipped the attribute vocabulary registry (`skein.api.vocab.alpha`): versioned declare!/reads with core and spool seeds.
- `26-07-11__large-attr-scaling` — completed the large-attribute scaling spike: committed measurement harness, baseline assessment, and a verdict staging future work; no spec deltas by design.
- `26-07-11__pin-sync-guard` — shipped the test-only guard that pinned-spool sync behavior cannot regress silently.
