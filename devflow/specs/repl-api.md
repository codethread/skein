## SPEC-003.P3 Contracts

- **SPEC-003.C1:** `connect!` selects one active weaver connection by Skein workspace for explicit Clojure client/test workflows. It requires an explicit selected workspace and optional state metadata supplied directly by standalone Clojure/test helpers. It never accepts a database path and no longer silently falls back to an XDG global workspace. Default `mill weaver repl` does not call `connect!`.
- **SPEC-003.C2:** `mill weaver repl` requires a running `mill`, asks it to resolve the selected workspace, verify that workspace's weaver is running, and return nREPL metadata, then attaches the user's terminal to the selected weaver nREPL endpoint. Mill does not proxy nREPL. Any launched attach client is transport/UI only: user forms are evaluated in the weaver JVM, not in a separate local runtime or through the fixed API bridge.
- **SPEC-003.C3:** `mill weaver repl --stdin` attaches to the selected running weaver nREPL, reads and evaluates top-level stdin forms in the weaver JVM in order, prints one direct normal Clojure result per form, and exits non-zero on read, eval, or transport failure. Callers that want one machine-readable payload should wrap work in one top-level `do` or `let`.
- **SPEC-003.C4:** `skein.repl` helpers keep the human-friendly implicit selected-weaver surface: inside the active weaver JVM they use the active runtime, and explicit Clojure client/test workflows use `connect!` plus the fixed-form client bridge. The `skein.api.*.alpha` domain namespaces do not perform implicit runtime discovery or connected-client routing; trusted in-process callers pass a runtime explicitly. This is a deliberate TEN-000@1 in-place rethink to make runtime ownership visible. Weaver/transport failures surface loudly as Clojure exceptions.
- **SPEC-003.C5:** `init!` is a trusted idempotent helper for explicit schema initialization/testing. Normal CLI setup does not require calling it because weaver startup prepares empty stores.
- **SPEC-003.C6:** `strand!` creates a strand and returns the created row. Supported arities include a title alone, title with attributes, and title with options containing optional `:state` and `:attributes`.
- **SPEC-003.C7:** `update!` accepts a strand id and patch map with optional `:title`, `:state`, `:attributes`, and `:edges`. Generic update accepts `active|closed`; `replaced` is reserved for supersession. Other lifecycle keys are not core strand fields.
- **SPEC-003.C8:** `:edges` are maps with `:type`, `:to`, and optional `:attributes`; each edge is written from the updated strand to `:to`. Edge `:type` values are open relation names matching `[a-z0-9][a-z0-9._/-]*`.
- **SPEC-003.C8a:** `supersede!` accepts `(supersede! old-id replacement-id)`, delegates to the weaver supersession operation, stores `replacement --supersedes--> old`, marks the old strand `replaced`, rewires incoming `depends-on` edges, and returns the normalized supersession result.
- **SPEC-003.C8b:** `burn!` and `burn-by-ids!` physically delete strands and incident edges through weaver burn primitives. Missing ids fail loudly.
- **SPEC-003.C9:** `defquery!` registers a named query expression or parameterized query map in the active weaver's in-memory query registry.
- **SPEC-003.C10:** `load-queries!` reads one EDN map of query names to query definitions and merges it into the active weaver's in-memory query registry.
- **SPEC-003.C11:** `queries` returns the active weaver's in-memory query registry. `query-explain` accepts a simple symbol, keyword, or string query name, resolves it against the active weaver's in-memory query registry, and returns serializable caller guidance with the same core fields as CLI `query explain`: canonical name, declared params, referenced params, the effective where expression, the normalized definition, exact EDN form strings, and a short invocation summary. Missing names fail loudly with the existing `query/not-found` behavior including available names. Explicit connected-client workflows route `query-explain` through the fixed-form client operation table.
- **SPEC-003.C12:** Query registry contents last only for the active weaver lifetime; reload trusted config or call `defquery!` / `load-queries!` again after weaver restart.
- **SPEC-003.C13:** `query` returns strands matching an ad hoc query definition or weaver-registered query name, with optional runtime parameters.
- **SPEC-003.C13a:** Query predicates include direct edge-existence forms `[:edge/out relation target-query]` and `[:edge/in relation source-query]`. `relation` is a valid relation-name string or a `[:param :name]` reference resolving to one. Endpoint queries are strand-local and fail loudly if they contain nested edge predicates.
- **SPEC-003.C14:** `strand`, `strands`, `query`, and `ready` return rows with JSON-bearing columns normalized to Clojure values and with the `state` lifecycle field.
- **SPEC-003.C15:** `ready` returns active strands whose direct `depends-on` dependencies are not active and may be further filtered by an ad hoc or registered query. This is equivalent to `[:and [:= :state "active"] [:not [:edge/out "depends-on" [:= :state "active"]]]]`.
- **SPEC-003.C15a:** `declare-acyclic-relation!` declares a valid relation name acyclic in durable storage and is idempotent. It fails loudly if edges of that relation already exist. `acyclic-relations` lists declared acyclic relation names.
- **SPEC-003.C16:** Blessed spool-workspace helpers live in explicit `skein.api.runtime.alpha`, not in the preloaded `skein.repl` helper namespace.
- **SPEC-003.C17:** `skein.api.runtime.alpha` exposes approved spool configuration, owner-complete module declaration and refresh, module/root status and planning, advanced code-only reload, a blessed runtime-local spool-state accessor for trusted spools, `clock` for the runtime-owned Clock, and `now` for its current `java.time.Instant` (SPEC-004.C1a).
- **SPEC-003.C17a:** `skein.api.clock.alpha` exposes the Clock capability — a validated value, not a protocol, so re-evaluating the namespace never strands a live clock the runtime already holds. `(now clock)` returns a `java.time.Instant`, and `(sleep! clock duration)` sleeps or advances for a non-negative `java.time.Duration` and returns nil. Zero Duration is valid. `(clock now-fn sleep-fn)` builds one, `(clock? value)` tests one, and `(system-clock)` returns the real production implementation. Invalid durations fail loudly.
- **SPEC-003.C17b:** `(skein.api.spool.alpha/poll-until! clock opts)` accepts exactly `:timeout-ms`, `:poll-ms`, `:check`, `:pred->result`, and `:on-timeout`. Timeout is a non-negative integer and cadence is a positive integer. It derives an Instant deadline from the supplied Clock, checks immediately, returns the first non-nil projected result, calls `on-timeout` with the last value at or after the deadline, and otherwise sleeps on the Clock before checking again. It validates the Clock and complete option boundary before polling.
- **SPEC-003.C18:** `skein.api.runtime.alpha` helpers all take the target runtime as their first argument. Trusted startup/config/spool code that needs the active in-process runtime captures it with `(skein.api.current.alpha/runtime)` at an entry point and threads it explicitly. Connected-client workflows do not route through `skein.api.runtime.alpha`; humans use `skein.repl`, and trusted tests or tools use `skein.core.client` with explicit workspace arguments.
- **SPEC-003.C19:** `skein.api.runtime.alpha` is the documented spool-workspace path. Namespace tiers are contractual: `skein.api.*.alpha` promises accretion-based back-compat within each subnamespace; breaking rethinks move to a new subnamespace. `skein.core.*` promises nothing and is for engine internals; trusted users may require it or read raw SQLite when they accept compatibility cost. `skein.spools.*` is the authorable/reference spool layer. `skein.repl` is the interactive human surface. `skein.userland.alpha` is the userland-only terse ergonomics tier: strictly downstream, never required by any `skein.*` namespace (SPEC-003.C24–C27). `skein.*` source namespaces are reserved for code shipped by the Skein checkout; external/shared spool source namespaces use the author's org prefix instead (codethread spools use `ct.spools.<name>`), keeping them disjoint from every `skein.*` tier.
- **SPEC-003.C19a:** Converted `skein.api.*.alpha` modules follow the v1 form contract. The `alpha` namespace reads public-first and tells the module's story: the promised vars lead, each carrying a docstring and its top-level composition — a public fn's body shows the meat of the algorithm as named steps (threading where natural) — including its concurrency shape: sequencing, fan-out, and blocking joins read at the top level — never a bare delegation husk. The default shape is one story-ordered file: private helpers below the publics in section-commented concern clusters, a `declare` block up top where reading order fights definition order (an accepted cost). Around five hundred lines the module tips into per-concern plumbing files under `skein.api.<module>.internal[.<concern>]`, which the exclusionary rule of SPEC-005.P1 places outside the contract regardless of var visibility; the line is a rough heuristic judged by the source-form review seat, not arithmetic a gate enforces. A module with no plumbing ships no internal namespace. Public vars stay defined in alpha, never re-exported from internal; an internal namespace (nested concern files included) never requires an alpha namespace, and among `src` namespaces only a module's own alpha or its own internal siblings require its internal. Every public fn's interface is identified from alpha: its named argument/return specs or `s/fdef` register there, keeping their qualified keys on the promised namespace; reusable sub-specs may live in internal when they are plumbing rather than promise. A public fn that is itself the authority for a data shape — a validator or parser whose body defines the grammar — documents that grammar in its docstrings instead of mirroring itself in a spec; a second source of truth is the failure mode there, not the fix. Source lines in a converted module's files stay within 96 columns, with docstrings and comments hard-wrapped in source. `quality.api-form` (run by `quality.conventions-check`) enforces the mechanical parts — public-var docstrings, width, the dependency rules, and the `pending` ratchet; the worked examples are `devflow/archive/26-07-18__g1men-v1-api-format/` and the `return-shape` module itself.
- **SPEC-003.C20:** `defpattern!` registers a simple pattern name, optional non-blank doc string, fully qualified function symbol, and input spec name in the active weaver's in-memory pattern registry. Supported arities are `(defpattern! name fn-sym input-spec)` and `(defpattern! name doc fn-sym input-spec)`. Duplicate registration replaces the prior entry. The same operations are available through the blessed `skein.api.patterns.alpha` namespace for trusted startup config and activated spools when callers pass the runtime explicitly.
- **SPEC-003.C21:** `patterns`, `pattern`, and `pattern-explain` inspect active weaver pattern state. Missing pattern lookup fails loudly. Explanations return serializable caller guidance based on the registered spec.
- **SPEC-003.C22:** `weave!` validates input against the registered spec, calls the registered function with `{:input input}`, requires the result to be a valid batch strand vector, and creates the batch atomically through the weaver.
- **SPEC-003.C23:** The direct per-entry registration functions across the graph, patterns, events, hooks, and weaver APIs (the explicit-owner `put-entry!`/`replace-entry!` core seam and the domain APIs layered over it) remain trusted sharp tools, but every write carries an explicit owner: a direct owner may replace its own keys, while cross-owner replacement requires explicit override intent. Module contribution publication reuses the same validators and effective-registry shapes without calling these functions entry by entry. Known constraint (**F20**): a direct write is not serialized against an in-flight `refresh!`. Publication resets each core registry to the candidate snapshot captured after evaluation and source loading, so a direct write landing in the narrow staging span between that capture and publication is silently overwritten; the window is small (only staged publication sits inside it), and reconcile-time direct writes run after publication and are safe. This trusted-REPL posture is accepted rather than lock-serialized (TEN-002); a caller needing a durable direct write across a concurrent refresh sequences it outside the refresh.
- **SPEC-003.C23a:** `skein.api.registry.alpha` is the blessed kind-declaration and owner-partition primitive for spool domains (SPEC-005.C2). It declares a registered kind — id, entry spec, binding-moment datum, and layer policy — so a declared kind becomes a valid key the refresh kernel publishes from a module contribution (SPEC-004.C46), and it exposes the direct owner-partition operations: replace or remove one complete owner partition, read immutable effective snapshots, and explain the active, shadowed, and override entries for a kind. It carries no generic resource or effect callbacks; domains do their baseline, durable-write, and lifecycle work through their own APIs around publication. The core owner-registry implementation it fronts stays internal (`skein.core.*`).

## SPEC-003.P4 Runtime transformation helpers

Skein ships blessed source-visible runtime transformation namespaces for trusted config, activated spools, and live in-weaver REPL forms. Except for client-side `skein.api.peers.alpha`, these namespaces take an explicit runtime first argument and never route through connected-client state:

- `skein.api.graph.alpha` exposes `(query-ids runtime query params)`, `(burn-by-ids! runtime ids)`, `(burn-by-ids! runtime ids req-ctx)`, `(strands-by-ids runtime ids)`, `(ancestor-root-ids runtime seed-ids)`, `(ancestor-root-ids runtime seed-ids opts)`, `(subgraph runtime root-ids)`, `(subgraph runtime root-ids opts)`, `(incoming-edges runtime to-ids edge-type)`, `(outgoing-edges runtime from-ids edge-type)`, `(register-query! runtime query-name query-def)`, `(queries runtime)`, `(resolve-query runtime query-name)`, and `(query-explain runtime query-name)`. Traversal opts may include `:type` for the declared acyclic relation to walk and default to `"parent-of"`; annotation relations fail loudly. `ancestor-root-ids` also preserves `:where`/`:params` filtering. `incoming-edges`/`outgoing-edges` are lenient single-hop adjacency lookups (an absent id yields no rows rather than a missing-id error). `register-query!` validates and merges a named query definition into the runtime registry; `queries`, `resolve-query`, and `query-explain` read it back. `burn-by-ids!`'s `req-ctx` arity threads an explicit request-context map (the same shape `skein.api.batch.alpha/apply!` accepts) into the `:strand/burn-before-commit` validation gate; the two-argument form derives its own burn context.
- `skein.api.patterns.alpha` exposes `(register-pattern! runtime name fn-sym input-spec)`, `(register-pattern! runtime name doc fn-sym input-spec)`, `(patterns runtime)`, `(resolve-pattern runtime name)`, `(explain runtime name)`, `(weave! runtime name input)`, and `(weave! runtime name input req-ctx)`. Pattern functions are weaver-loadable function symbols called with `{:input input}` after input spec validation. `resolve-pattern` matches `skein.api.graph.alpha/resolve-query` naming; the interactive tiers (`skein.repl`, `skein.userland.alpha`) surface it as `pattern` per SPEC-003.C21. The `req-ctx` arity threads an explicit request-context map (the same shape `skein.api.batch.alpha/apply!` accepts) for trusted callers such as the connected-client tier; the three-argument form derives its own weave context.
- `skein.api.events.alpha` exposes `(register-handler! runtime key types fn-sym)`, `(register-handler! runtime key types fn-sym metadata)`, `(unregister-handler! runtime key)`, `(handlers runtime)`, and `(recent-failures runtime)`. Registration validates the stable key, non-empty keyword type set, weaver-resolvable function symbol, and data-first metadata, replaces prior entries by key, and returns the data-first entry. Event submission is not public surface: mutation operations submit events internally through the dispatch lane (SPEC-004.C73), and the blocking event-lane quiescence await ships as the test primitive `skein.test.alpha/await-quiescent!` (SPEC-004.C74b).
- `skein.api.hooks.alpha` exposes `(register-hook! runtime key types fn-sym)`, `(register-hook! runtime key types fn-sym opts)`, `(unregister-hook! runtime key)`, and `(hooks runtime)`. Hook keys are stable keywords, symbols, or non-blank strings; hook type sets are non-empty keyword sets; function symbols are fully qualified and weaver-resolvable; `opts` may include `:order` and data-first metadata. Registration replaces by key, `hooks` returns deterministic data-first entries, validation hooks return normally or throw, and transform hooks return `{:hook/value replacement}`.
- `skein.api.peers.alpha` exposes `(peers)` (data-first sibling weaver metadata rows with staleness) and `(call! peerish op args)` (invoke one allowlisted public JSON socket operation; a name or explicitly path-like workspace resolves one running peer, and unknown/stale/ambiguous peers fail loudly). Both are client-side: they read published runtime metadata and speak to peer sockets from the calling process, behaving identically inside the live weaver JVM and in explicit connected client/test workflows. See the Weaver Runtime spec, SPEC-004.P10c.
- `skein.api.current.alpha` exposes `(runtime)`, the blessed facade for reading the active in-process weaver runtime. It fails loudly when no active runtime exists and never falls back to connected-client state. Its non-throwing sibling `(runtime-or-nil)` is the single sanctioned way to *probe* for an ambient runtime, returning nil rather than throwing so trusted resolvers can branch on absence instead of catching an exception as control flow. It also exposes `(with-runtime* runtime thunk)` and the `(with-runtime runtime & body)` macro, the blessed scoping twins that bind `runtime` as the thread-local ambient runtime for a dynamic extent so nested `(runtime)` reads and explicit-runtime callees agree without threading the runtime through every call.
- `skein.api.batch.alpha` exposes `(apply! runtime payload)` for transactional batch graph mutation payloads with `:refs`, `:strands`, `:edges`, and `:burn`. It returns normalized Clojure data from the weaver operation, including final refs, created rows, updated before/after rows, burned rows, and edge outcomes, without a JSON envelope.
- `skein.api.format.alpha` exposes `(fill block)` and `(reflow block)`, the pure `|`-margin doc-block helpers for publishing prose as data (op payloads, `about` surfaces, config rule descriptions). Unlike the rest of this list they take no runtime argument. Both fail loudly on a block with no barred lines (TEN-003) instead of returning empty output.

Helpers execute weaver-side when called from `init.clj`, activated runtime spools, or the live weaver REPL after the caller passes an explicit runtime. Connected client users who want to register new pattern, event handler, or hook functions should place them in weaver-loadable config/spool code and register their symbols through `skein.repl` or trusted `skein.core.client` calls. Pattern, event, and hook registrations are weaver-lifetime runtime state unless user config reloads them on startup.

User config may require `skein.api.graph.alpha`, `skein.api.patterns.alpha`, `skein.api.events.alpha`, `skein.api.hooks.alpha`, `skein.api.batch.alpha`, and `skein.api.format.alpha` so users can inspect and extend the blessed path. These built-in namespaces come from the Skein checkout on the weaver classpath; they do not require `spools.edn` approval.

Hook functions receive one context map and run synchronously at the lifecycle gates specified by the Weaver Runtime contract. They may reject by throwing; only explicit transform hook families may replace values. Hook registration, unregistration, and introspection are trusted Clojure workflows and are not public JSON socket operations.

Event handlers receive one event map and may perform trusted side effects, including calling Skein APIs. They are dispatched asynchronously after successful mutation commits; handler return values are ignored. `(events/recent-failures)` returns bounded, data-first failure records for handler exceptions. Handler exceptions do not fail the already-committed mutation.

## SPEC-003.P4a Scheduler helpers

`skein.api.scheduler.alpha` is a blessed source-visible explicit-runtime namespace for the weaver-owned no-poller scheduler primitive (SPEC-004.P10d), usable from trusted config, activated spools, and live in-weaver REPL forms. Like the rest of the P4 helpers it takes the target runtime as its first argument for every operation, never performs connected-client routing or implicit ambient lookup, and expects callers to capture the runtime with `skein.api.current.alpha/runtime` only at trusted entry points.

- **SPEC-003.C58:** `(schedule! runtime wake)` persists or replaces one durable wake and arms it. `wake` is a map with a stable `:key`, an absolute `:wake-at` (`java.time.Instant`), a fully qualified `:handler` symbol resolvable in the weaver classloader, and an optional `:payload` (nil or a JSON-object-encodable map). Replacing an existing key resets its attempt count. Unknown keys, malformed values, unsupported payloads, and unresolvable/non-callable handlers fail loudly and persist nothing.
- **SPEC-003.C59a:** `(cancel! runtime key)` cancels a pending wake by stable key and returns data-first cancellation information; a missing key fails loudly. No separately named idempotent cancel helper ships.
- **SPEC-003.C59b:** `(pending runtime)` returns serializable data-first maps for pending scheduler wakes. It never exposes functions, executors, timer handles, or raw JDBC rows. The earliest pending wake is `(first (pending runtime))`, since `pending` is ordered by wake-at ascending; no dedicated public accessor is exposed.
- **SPEC-003.C59c:** Handler symbols resolve in the weaver JVM/runtime classloader, matching event/pattern conventions, and are persisted as a symbol/string representation that survives restart; closures and anonymous functions are rejected. Handlers receive one context map (SPEC-004.C103), run through the weaver's serialized async lane, have their return value ignored, and exceptions do not crash the scheduler.
- **SPEC-003.C59d:** The default timing recommendation remains pull-based `wake-at` strand attributes plus named queries when a poller exists. The scheduler API is documented as the no-poller proactive-wakeup escape hatch, and the first public surface is REPL/API-only — no mutating public `strand schedule` command is introduced; a thin read-only CLI may be added later if a concrete user needs it.

## SPEC-003.P5 Runtime spool workspace helpers

`skein.api.runtime.alpha` is the blessed alpha namespace for trusted config, activated spools, and live in-weaver REPL spool workspace workflows. Its functions take an explicit runtime first argument. `skein.api.current.alpha` exposes the blessed `(runtime)` facade for capturing the active in-process weaver runtime at trusted entry points, alongside its non-throwing `(runtime-or-nil)` probe sibling. It is explicit and is not preloaded into `skein.repl`. Loader/config helpers do not live under `skein.spools.*`; that namespace family is reserved for authorable spools and examples. Across the namespace map, `skein.api.*.alpha` is the accreting compatibility tier, `skein.core.*` is internal with no compatibility promise, `skein.spools.*` is authorable userland/reference code, and `skein.repl` is the interactive surface.

Approved spool config comes from `spools.edn` plus `spools.local.edn` in the selected workspace. Each
`spools.edn` key is a family symbol. A local family is `{:local/root path}`. A git family requires
`:git/url` and `:git/sha`, and may add `:git/tag`, `:roots`, `:requires`, and `:skein/min`. `:roots`
maps one or more root-lib symbols to relative paths within the pinned checkout; without it, the
family supplies one root at `"."`. `:requires` maps root libs to minimum positive `vN` markers.
`:git/tag` and `:skein/min` use the same marker grammar. Root libs must have unique owners across all
families. Unknown keys, mixed kinds, malformed pins or paths, duplicate root owners, and unsatisfied
release floors fail loudly before materialization.

`spools.local.edn` may replace a shared git family with `{:local/root path :claims "vN"}`. The local
coordinate applies to the whole family and inherits its root map and compatibility floors. The
claim states which release contract the local tree satisfies. Relative local roots resolve against
the selected workspace; absolute paths and home expansion remain explicit approvals. Normalized
approved config is keyed by root lib. Each value has `:kind`, kind-specific source fields, effective
`:root`, and source metadata. Refresh root outcomes add `:lib`, owning `:family`, normalized family
`:coordinate`, provenance, and `:status`; failures also carry `:reason` and reason-specific diagnostics. Missing
roots, expected git/I/O acquisition failures, and tag mismatches are per-root outcomes. Unexpected
JVM throwables and atomic Maven-resolution failures escape loudly.

Spool metadata and spool prerequisites are documentation, not REPL API grammar. Shared spool authors document prerequisites, suggested pins, and module order in their README using the convention described by `docs/spools/writing-shared-spools.md`. Runtime approval and refresh acquisition ignore a source tree's `spool.edn`; `spools.edn` in the selected workspace remains authoritative. The batteries `spool add` helper may read a producer's optional advisory `spool.edn` only while constructing a new workspace entry (SPEC-003.C63a).

Helpers include:

- `(runtime/approved runtime)` returns normalized approved config.
- `(runtime/module! runtime key opts)` declares one owner under a stable keyword, with exactly one `:ns` or `:file` source, optional `:spools` and `:after` prerequisites, optional `:contribute` and `:reconcile` symbols, and optional `:required?` policy.
- `(runtime/refresh! runtime)` re-reads the layered startup graph, acquires approved roots, reloads changed module source, publishes owner-complete contributions, and reconciles resources. Its targeted arity accepts `{:only [...]}`.
- `(runtime/plan runtime)` returns the same joined intention shape without acquisition, publication, reconciliation, or coordinator-state mutation.
- `(runtime/status runtime)` returns the offline joined graph, contribution, module, resource, root, loaded-code, residual, conflict, pending-generation, and last-refresh state.
- `(runtime/reload-code! runtime root-lib)` resolves a root-lib from a family's effective `:roots`
  map through its per-root successful sync state and reloads that root's source files in dependency
  order. It reloads code only; publication and resource reconciliation require refresh.
- `(runtime/clock runtime)` returns the runtime-owned `skein.api.clock.alpha/Clock` used for time reads and sleeps (SPEC-004.C1a).
- `(runtime/now runtime)` returns that Clock's current `java.time.Instant`. It remains the convenient data-first read for trusted spools and takes the runtime first (SPEC-003.C18).

Module `:file` targets are selected-workspace relative and may not escape the
workspace. Module `:ns` targets are ledger-loaded from the complete synchronized
root closure, including roots reached through `:after` dependencies. Classpath
modules such as batteries declare no `:spools`. A full refresh removes an owner
by omission; targeted refresh includes affected dependents and cannot remove an
unselected owner.

Maven dependencies declared in an approved spool root's top-level `deps.edn :deps` are part of the spool sync contract described by SPEC-004. Version ranges, alternate approved-spool config files, source fetching beyond approved spool coordinates, and direct explicit-client `require` of newly synced weaver spools remain outside the REPL API contract.

## SPEC-003.P5b Blessed op argv parser

- **SPEC-003.C60:** `skein.api.cli.alpha` is the blessed declarative argv parser for weaver ops: a data-first arg-spec (named typed flags, including value-consuming `:string`, `:int`, `:boolean-token`, presence `:boolean`, `key=value` `:map`, repeatable flags, positionals, per-arg docs, payload-parse declarations) parses envelope argv into a data map or throws a loud structured error naming the offending token and the op's spec. The same arg-spec powers `help <op>` rendering via a JSON-safe `explain` projection. `skein.api.return-shape.alpha` is the blessed pure return-shape companion shared by registry validation, help, author tests, and real spool-to-spool consumption seams; it exposes `validate!`, `explain`, and `check!` without runtime, registry, socket, or CLI parser state. Spool authors may layer clojure.spec/malli on the parsed input map; both declaration surfaces stay data-first.
- **SPEC-003.C60a:** A return shape is a finite inline EDN tree. Scalar leaves are `:string`, `:integer`, `:number`, `:boolean`, `:null`, and `:json`; `:json` accepts any JSON-compatible value. `[:nullable <scalar>]` accepts nil or `:string`, `:integer`, `:number`, or `:boolean`; it cannot wrap maps, collections, `:json`, `:null`, or another nullable form. Maps declare `{:type :map :required {<keyword> <shape> ...} :optional {<keyword> <shape> ...} :extra <shape>}`. Required and optional default to empty, may not overlap, and undeclared keys fail checking unless `:extra` supplies their common value shape. Homogeneous sequential collections declare `{:type :collection :items <shape>}`. The language has no functions, arbitrary predicates, coercions, defaults, general unions, named references, or recursive declarations.
- **SPEC-003.C60b:** A flat non-stream op uses a shape directly. A subcommand op mirrors its arg-spec tree: an interior return node is `{:subcommands {<name-string> <return-node> ...}}`, and a leaf return node is a return case; names match the arg-spec exactly at every level. A streaming return case declares `{:stream {:emits <shape> :result <shape>}}`; a non-stream case is a shape. `validate!` returns valid authored data unchanged or fails loudly, `explain` returns the declaration as JSON-safe data, and `check!` returns a conforming value unchanged or throws structured mismatch data carrying at least the failing path, expected shape, actual value. Selection context carries the full subcommand path.
- **SPEC-003.C61:** Payload reference resolution is a parser contract: a **whole** argv value of `:stdin` or `:payload/<name>` resolves to the named envelope payload string; no substring interpolation. A reference without a matching payload fails loudly; an attached payload nothing references fails loudly. An arg may declare `:parse :json`/`:jsonl` to parse the resolved payload, failing loudly with context on malformed input. Ops registered without an arg-spec receive the raw envelope and own their argv/payload handling.
- **SPEC-003.C62:** Op registration/override from trusted config and REPL uses `skein.api.weaver.alpha/register-op!` (loud on name collision) and `replace-op!` (explicit override); entries carry op metadata, including optional `:returns`, and registry-recorded provenance (SPEC-004.C63a–d). Workspace `defop` and direct spool registrations pass `:returns` through the same metadata route; there is no second macro or registry.
- **SPEC-003.C63:** The shipped `skein.spools.batteries` reference spool (classpath, `skein.spools.*` tier) registers the public strand command surface as parser-backed ops; its behavior contract lives at `spools/batteries.md`. Workspaces may mask or replace batteries; a workspace without it retains core `help` discovery and loud unknown-op errors.
- **SPEC-003.C63a:** Batteries registers `spool add <git-url> [--tag vN] [--lib family]`, `spool bump <family> [--to vN]`, and `spool status`. Add and bump contact the Git remote to list annotated release tags; add also fetches the optional advisory `spool.edn` at the selected peeled commit. Both accept only `vN` tags for positive integer `N`, resolve `refs/tags/vN^{}` to the peeled commit SHA, and write the tag/SHA pair through the validated comment-preserving atomic `spools.edn` write verb. A supplied `--lib` must match a root symbol in a present advisory manifest; without a manifest it confirms or overrides the implicit URL-basename root at `.`. `spool status` is offline and read-only: it performs no Git call, file write, refresh, or adoption action while joining declared families with root outcomes, modules, pending generation, and the running release marker. It joins every declared family off its normalized root set — a declaration that omits `:roots`, including a bare `:local/root` coordinate, carries the implicit `{family "."}` sole-root that normalization already applied — so a rootless declaration is projected, never rejected at read time. The separate `spool-status` op is retired without an alias under TEN-000@1.
- **SPEC-003.C63b:** A successful spool bump always returns `:compare-url`. GitHub HTTPS,
  SSH, and SCP remotes become HTTPS web URLs before the compare path is added. Other HTTP(S)
  remotes retain their transport URL without a trailing `.git`; unrecognized non-HTTP(S) remotes
  return nil because no usable web URL can be inferred. `spool status` validates
  its complete closed result after joining family root and module projections.
- **SPEC-003.C63f:** Approved opt-in reference spools may layer their own explicit-runtime helpers and parser-backed ops on this surface. `skein.spools.workflow` is a worked example: an approved opt-in spool declared by a `:spools`-guarded module, with explicit-runtime helpers and a parser-backed op. Its behavior contract lives at `spools/workflow.md`, not in this spec.
- **SPEC-003.C64:** An arg-spec node declaring `:subcommands` maps subcommand names to nested nodes of the same shape at any depth. A leaf declares no `:subcommands`; its `:flags` and `:positionals` are optional, so doc-only leaves are valid. An interior node may not also declare `:flags`, `:positionals`, `:hook-class`, or `:deadline-class`; an empty `:subcommands {}` is invalid. Every leaf of an op declaring an arg-spec carries `:hook-class` (`:read` or `:mutating`) and `:deadline-class` (`:standard` or `:unbounded`); a flat arg-spec root is its leaf. A streaming leaf declares `:deadline-class :unbounded`. One shared structural validator enforces these rules recursively. It rejects `help`, `-h`, `--help`, and the `subcommand` arg name at every level; `parse` and `explain` consult it, and the op registry reuses it for registration-time failure (SPEC-004.C63d).
- **SPEC-003.C65:** Parsing a subcommand arg-spec routes recursively: each argv token selects a child node until a leaf is reached, then the remaining argv parses against that leaf. The parsed map merges the leaf result with `:subcommand`, always the full path as a vector of name strings. A missing or unknown token fails loudly with canonical context: `:op` (string), `:path` (tokens already walked), `:token` (or nil when missing), and `:available` (child names at the failing node). Payload references and `:parse` declarations (SPEC-003.C61) apply unchanged at every depth. Structural validation, parsing, socket pre-hook walking, help slicing, and return selection use the same context shape.
- **SPEC-003.C66 (help envelope/node projection):** The help envelope (SPEC-002.C39/C44) is built by a level-aware projection. Op-wide facts — `provenance`, `stream?`, `raw-envelope`, and resolved `source` (SPEC-004.C107) — are lifted into the response envelope's `operation` and `source`. `hook-class` and `deadline-class` are node keys: populated on invocable leaves and null on interior nodes and subcommand-op roots. The node is normalized recursively from arg-spec and return-shape `explain` into the uniform node shape (SPEC-002.C44); a raw-envelope root is its leaf. Per-node closed annotations apply at every depth, and glossary-ref existence checks walk every depth on direct registration and generation publication after glossary contributions merge.
- **SPEC-003.C67 (per-node annotations — closed sub-map on the arg-spec node):** `use-when`, `notes`, and `failure-modes` are authored as a closed, validated annotation sub-map on each arg-spec node, or on the root metadata equivalent for raw-envelope ops. `use-when` and `notes` are string arrays; `failure-modes` is an array of glossary outcome names. The structural validator validates closed keys and non-blank strings without runtime dependency. At registration, `register-op!` and `replace-op!` check every glossary reference against the live glossary; module publication does so after each generation's glossary contributions merge and before the generation becomes effective. The projection folds each node's annotations into that node; `about` prose remains cross-verb narrative.
- **SPEC-003.C68 (help paths vs parse depth):** Help paths are live to the arg-spec's declared depth: `strand help <op> <verb> [<verb> ...]` slices to any named node, including interior nodes with children. Unknown tokens fail loudly with the C65 context. Arbitrary-depth recursion is proven by live operations as well as renderer tests.
- **SPEC-003.C69 (`about`/`prime` are arity-1):** Only `help` nests on the verb axis (its content *is* the verb tree). `about` and `prime` are arity-1 op-level meta-verbs (SPEC-002.C46): a verb path (`strand about agent delegate`) fails loudly with a redirect to `help agent delegate`. The `:about`/`:prime` prose is op-declared metadata (SPEC-004.C109), not sliceable.

## SPEC-003.P5a Userland ergonomics module

`skein.userland.alpha` is a blessed but **userland-only** terse ergonomics layer over the explicit-runtime API. It lets trusted userland config (`init.clj`), local glue, and tooling hold one weaver runtime and make terse calls (`(ready)`, `(strand! "title")`) instead of threading the runtime through every `skein.api.*.alpha` call. Ergonomics at the cost of hidden ambient resolution is a trade users are allowed to make; skein namespaces are not.

- **SPEC-003.C24:** `skein.userland.alpha` is a strict downstream consumer tier.
  No `skein.*` namespace — engine, blessed API, shipped spool, or `skein.repl` —
  may require it. This invariant is guarded by a test that fails if any
  repo-owned `skein.*` or shipped-spool source requires the module. Shared/distributed
  spools are held to the same rule by review and the shared-spool guidance doc.
- **SPEC-003.C25:** It holds one runtime and resolves every terse call in order:
  the innermost `with-runtime` scope, then the `bind!` default, then
  `skein.api.current.alpha/runtime` (active startup binding or published
  runtime), else a loud failure with userland remediation (TEN-003). It works
  with unpublished runtimes and performs no connected-client routing.
- **SPEC-003.C26:** `bind!`/`unbind!`/`bound` manage a module-local default
  runtime; `bind!` does not publish a process ambient runtime and affects only
  this module's terse calls. `(with-runtime runtime & body)` (macro) and
  `(with-runtime* runtime thunk)` (fn) additionally bind the shared ambient
  runtime for their dynamic extent (via `skein.api.current.alpha`), so nested
  reads and shared code see the same runtime; independent scopes do not
  cross-talk. `(runtime)` returns the resolved runtime as an escape hatch for
  the explicit-runtime surface this module does not wrap (graph, events,
  hooks).
- **SPEC-003.C27:** The terse wrappers mirror `skein.repl`'s vocabulary bound to
  the resolved runtime: `init!`, `strand!`, `strand`, `update!`, `supersede!`,
  `burn!`, `strands`, `query`, `ready`, `defquery!`, `load-queries!`, `queries`,
  `query-explain`, `declare-acyclic-relation!`, `acyclic-relations`,
  `defpattern!`, `patterns`, `pattern`, `pattern-explain`, `weave!`, and `apply!`
  (batch). One deliberate signature divergence: `load-queries!` takes an
  already-parsed EDN map of named query definitions, not the file path
  `skein.repl/load-queries!` reads from disk — trusted in-process code owns its
  own I/O. Positioning: `skein.repl` is the interactive human, connection-aware
  surface; `skein.userland.alpha` is the trusted userland-code surface holding an
  explicit in-process runtime. Same terse vocabulary, different runtime
  ownership model.

## SPEC-003.P6 Example spool init

Selected workspace startup files (`init.clj`, then `init.local.clj`) declare the desired module graph:

```clojure
(require '[skein.api.current.alpha :as current]
         '[skein.api.runtime.alpha :as runtime])

(def runtime (current/runtime))
(runtime/module! runtime :my/module
  {:ns 'my.module.alpha
   :spools ['my/module]
   :contribute 'my.module.alpha/contribute
   :reconcile 'my.module.alpha/reconcile})
```

A selected workspace `spools.edn` approves local roots:

```clojure
{:spools {my/module {:local/root "spools/my-module"}}}
```

## SPEC-003.P7 Non-goals

The REPL API does not expose old helper names such as `task!`, `task`, or `tasks`, or bespoke helpers such as `depends!`, `edge!`, `done!`, `by-attr`, `deps`, `blocking`, or `graph`. Those are either covered by `update!` or the generic query/API helpers.

The REPL API does not add CLI package authoring commands, package installation, source fetching, or plugin-directory loading.

## SPEC-003.P8 Author-side test helpers

- **SPEC-003.C28:** `skein.test.alpha` is the blessed author-side test namespace for disposable weaver worlds. It ships from `src/skein/test/alpha.clj` so external library test JVMs can require it by adding a selected Skein checkout as a tools.deps `:local/root` test dependency. It is a dev/test helper loaded in the author's test JVM, not a weaver runtime activation API and not a public CLI surface. The durable vocabulary is `with-weaver-world`, `weaver-world-fixture` (binding `*weaver-world*` for `clojure.test` fixtures), `repl!`, `spool-checkout-root`, `check-op-return!`, `await-quiescent!`, and the deterministic-clock controls `manual-clock`, `set-clock!`, and `advance!` (SPEC-003.C28a). `check-op-return!` accepts an explicit runtime, operation, optional full subcommand-path vector or stream-channel context, and a captured value; it resolves the registered declaration, delegates to `skein.api.return-shape.alpha/check!`, returns the value on success, and throws mismatch data naming the operation, selected declaration, failing path, and actual value.
- **SPEC-003.C28a:** `(skein.test.alpha/manual-clock instant)` returns an uninstalled Clock whose sleep advances virtual time and runs no pumps. `(set-clock! runtime clock)` installs a Clock and rejects non-Clock values. One manual Clock may be installed in only one runtime; once installed, its zero or positive sleeps run that runtime's clock pumps synchronously. `(advance! runtime duration)` requires an installed manual Clock and a strictly positive Duration, advances it, runs the same pumps, and returns the new Instant. Installing and advancing manual time are author-side test controls; production callers use `skein.api.runtime.alpha/clock` or `now` (SPEC-003.C17, SPEC-004.C1a).
- **SPEC-003.C29:** `with-weaver-world` creates an isolated generated workspace (or uses an explicit `:root`), writes requested `config.json`, `spools.edn`, `init.clj`, and workspace-relative fixture files, starts an unpublished in-process weaver runtime with explicit storage selection (`:sqlite-file` default, `:sqlite-memory` supported), binds an orchestration context map for the body, and stops the weaver and cleans up deterministically afterwards. Worlds nest and run concurrently. Startup, fixture, eval, stop, and cleanup failures fail loudly; cleanup failures during body failure attach as suppressed exceptions rather than masking the body error. Helpers never touch the user's default config/data/state workspaces, and generated worlds use short temp roots to stay inside Unix socket path limits.
- **SPEC-003.C30:** `repl!` evaluates weaver-routed forms (quoted forms rendered with pr-str, or source strings) against the world's weaver over its real nREPL transport with the runtime ambiently bound, so `skein.api.current.alpha/runtime` resolves to the test weaver. Results must be EDN-readable data; weaver-side and transport failures throw ExceptionInfo with weaver/client context. The namespace deliberately provides no general assertion DSL, per-command wrappers, spool activation wrappers, or CLI subprocess helpers. `check-op-return!` is its sole output-contract helper: it checks values already captured by an op-owner test and does not invoke an op. Each owner suite derives its production operations and required flat, subcommand, and stream leaves from registry provenance and declarations, requires `:returns` on every owned op, and records at least one `check-op-return!` call per leaf; parallel hand-maintained op or expected-leaf lists do not define coverage.
- **SPEC-003.C31:** The context map exposes orchestration facts only: `:config-dir`, `:state-dir`, `:data-dir`, `:db-path` (file storage only), `:storage`, `:source` (the Skein checkout on the test classpath), `:runtime`, `:metadata`, and `:timeout-ms`.
- **SPEC-003.C32:** `spool-checkout-root` resolves the directory checkout backing a spool source resource on the author's test classpath so tests can approve that checkout as a generated `spools.edn` `:local/root`. It takes a classpath-relative source path, requires a file-backed classpath resource, derives the supplying classpath entry from the resource location, and returns the nearest ancestor whose `deps.edn` declares that exact entry in `:paths`. The one-argument form uses `clojure.java.io/resource`; the two-argument form accepts a resource-loader function from resource path string to `java.net.URL` or nil. Missing resources, jar-backed resources, and directory resources without the expected `deps.edn`/`:paths` checkout layout fail loudly with ExceptionInfo.
