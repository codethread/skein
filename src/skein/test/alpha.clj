  "Blessed author-side clojure.test helpers for disposable weaver worlds.

  This namespace runs in the author's test JVM and orchestrates real weaver
  runtimes in isolated temporary workspaces: it writes requested config
  fixtures (`config.json`, `spools.edn`, `init.clj`, arbitrary workspace
  files), starts an unpublished in-process weaver runtime with explicit
  storage selection, exposes an orchestration context map, and stops/cleans up
  afterwards. Weaver-side behavior is exercised through `repl!`, which
  evaluates weaver-routed forms over the runtime's real nREPL transport.

  Deliberately out of scope: strand/query wrappers, assertion DSLs, spool
  activation wrappers, CLI subprocess helpers, and any use of the user's
  default config/data/state workspaces. Generated worlds are isolated and
  disposable by default."

  `namespaces` is a collection of test-namespace symbols. The run reuses the

  (`skein.test-runner/run-focused-core`), so a warm focused run accepts and
  rejects exactly the namespace set a cold `clojure -M:test <ns...>` run does:
  an add-libs shard namespace, or a namespace not declared in the runner's
  island sets, fails loudly. The runner is resolved at call time
  (`requiring-resolve`) because it lives on the test classpath while this
  namespace is on the main classpath, so requiring `skein.test.alpha` outside a
  test JVM is unaffected.

  This is the agent-facing entry for the per-worktree warm test REPL. A warm
  focused run is never a validation gate — the cold focused run is; `run-focused!`
  exists for sub-second iteration only, and returns rather than exits so it is

  resolves to the test weaver. Results must be EDN-readable; weaver-side and
