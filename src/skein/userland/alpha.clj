  "Userland-only terse ergonomics over the explicit-runtime Skein API.

  RFC-016 made runtime passing explicit everywhere: `skein.api.*.alpha` take the
  target weaver runtime as their first argument. That is right for engine and
  shared-spool code, but userland config (`init.clj`), local glue, and tooling
  that legitimately work against ONE runtime end up threading it through every
  call. This module lets trusted userland code hold a single runtime once - via
  `bind!` or a `with-runtime` scope - and then make terse calls like
  `(ready)` or `(strand! \"title\")`. Hidden ambient magic is a trade USERS are
  allowed to make; skein namespaces are not.

  Positioning vs `skein.repl`: same terse vocabulary, different runtime
  ownership model. `skein.repl` is the interactive HUMAN surface - it is
  connection-aware (`connect!` plus a remote nREPL client bridge) and routes to a
  published/connected weaver. This module is the trusted USERLAND-CODE surface -
  it holds one in-process runtime (published OR unpublished, e.g. tests and
  embedded tooling that started with `:publish? false`), does no connection
  routing, and fails loudly when no runtime is resolvable. Connected/interactive
  work belongs in `skein.repl`; hold-your-own-runtime work belongs here.

  Runtime resolution order for every terse call: the innermost `with-runtime`
  scope, then the `bind!` default, then `skein.api.current.alpha/runtime` (the
  active startup binding or the published runtime), else a loud failure
  (TEN-003). `with-runtime` also binds the shared ambient runtime so nested
  `(current/runtime)` reads and explicit-runtime callees see the same runtime;
  `bind!` is module-local and only affects this module's terse calls, so scope
  the shared ambient with `with-runtime` when nested/shared code must agree.

  USERLAND-ONLY, FOREVER: no `skein.*` namespace may require this module. It is a
  strict downstream consumer tier and must never sit upstream of the engine,
  blessed API, shipped spools, or REPL surface. Shared/distributed spools must
  keep taking the runtime explicitly (see docs/writing-shared-spools.md); this
  ergonomics layer is for workspace-local config, tests, and glue only."
