  "Weaver-owned clock trigger: arm durable wakes and dispatch due handlers.

  This is the runtime half of the scheduler primitive (RFC-009,
  DELTA-weaver-scheduler-runtime-001); durable storage lives in
  `skein.core.db`. The subsystem owns exactly one runtime state, held through
  `skein.api.runtime.alpha/spool-state` under a declared version with a
  close-on-stop hook, and never a module-level atom.

  Lifecycle:
  - `rearm!` is the post-config entry point. `skein.core.weaver.runtime/start!`
    calls it after selected startup files finish loading, and
    `skein.core.weaver.runtime/reload-config!` calls it after config reload, so
    handlers supplied by approved spools/config are resolvable before any timer
    arms. `rearm!` cancels the in-memory timer, discards stale in-flight claims,
    and rebuilds from durable pending rows.
  - Runtime stop closes the executor through the spool-state `:close-fn` before
    storage closes.

  Dispatch model (DELTA-weaver-scheduler-runtime-001.CC8): a single-thread
  scheduled executor drives timing only. When a wake is due it records the
  delivery attempt and offers a `:scheduler/fire` envelope onto the existing
  serialized event-system queue; handler invocation and every terminal state
  transition (complete/fail/cancel) run on the shared lane via `run-fire!`, so
  clock-triggered handlers and post-commit event handlers share one mutation
  lane. The only durable write on the timer thread is the atomic attempt
  increment, and it tolerates a row vanishing under a concurrent cancel. Precise
  re-arm (next non-in-flight pending row) is the only arming mechanism; there is
  deliberately no periodic safety tick (DELTA-weaver-scheduler-runtime-001.D3).

  Delivery is at-least-once (PROP-weaver-scheduler-001.NG2): an in-memory
  in-flight set suppresses double-dispatch within one process lifetime, and
  durable pending rows re-arm across restart/reload. Queue-full is transient —
  the durable wake stays pending, a bounded dispatch-failure signal is recorded,
  and the scheduler re-arms after a short backoff rather than dropping the wake.

  Handler invocation contract (DELTA-weaver-scheduler-runtime-001.CC9): a wake
  handler is a fully qualified symbol resolved in the runtime spool classloader
  and invoked with one context map. Its return value is ignored. The context map
  keys are:

    :runtime  - the weaver runtime the wake fired in
    :key      - the stable wake key (string)
    :wake-at  - the scheduled instant (java.time.Instant)
    :attempt  - delivery attempt count for this fire (long, >= 1)
    :handler  - the fully qualified handler symbol
    :payload  - the decoded payload map, or nil when none was scheduled

  Unresolvable handler symbols and handler exceptions are captured as failed
  fires in scheduler history and never propagate into the event worker, so one
  bad handler cannot kill the dispatch lane."
