(ns skein.core.weaver.spool-sync
  "Approved-spool config parsing, git/local materialization, and runtime sync.

  Reads and validates the `spools.edn`/`spools.local.edn` allowlist, materializes
  git-pinned spool roots into the content-addressed cache, vets each root's
  Maven dependencies, and loads approved roots into a runtime's spool classloader
  while recording per-spool sync outcomes. Also resolves and loads module-use
  targets — `:file` paths confined to the config-dir and `:ns` sources located
  under synced roots — for `skein.api.runtime.alpha/use!`. Internal tier: the
  trusted `skein.api.runtime.alpha` surface delegates its
  `approved`/`declared`/`sync!`/`syncs` publics and its module loading here and
  owns the blessed contract (SPEC-004, SPEC-005.C5)."

(defn reload-synced-spool!
  "Make `root-lib`'s latest synced source live under the spool classloader.

  Resolves `root-lib` from the runtime's root-lib-keyed approved-spool sync state
  and approved allowlist (a root can be approved yet unsynced or sync-failed),
  discovers its namespace sources under the consented `root-paths` classpath, sorts
  them dependencies-first with `org.clojure/tools.namespace` (intra-root edges only),
  and `load-file`s each inside `with-spool-classloader`. Unlike `load-synced-namespace!`
  there is no load-once short-circuit — already-loaded namespaces are reloaded. A
  bumped cross-namespace macro is therefore live for its consumers, which reload
  after it. External requires are edges out of the set and are not reloaded, so this
  is neither `refresh` (classloader-blind to spool roots) nor `require :reload-all`
  (reloads transitive non-spool deps).

  Fails loudly with a reused `:reason` in ex-data (mirroring `sync-failed`'s
  `{:status :failed :reason …}` shape), checked in fixed order:
  `:not-approved` → `:not-synced` → `:sync-failed` → `:missing-root` →
  `:unreadable-root` → `:no-namespaces`. The on-disk root re-check mirrors
  `sync-approved-spool!`'s `exists`/`isDirectory`/`canRead` gate, so a root replaced
  by a file or permission-stripped since sync fails with `:missing-root`/
  `:unreadable-root` rather than a raw `load-file` exception carrying no `:reason`.

  Two further reasons surface at reload-ordering time, once the root is confirmed
  loadable: `:duplicate-namespace` (two sources under the root declare the same
  namespace, which would otherwise silently drop one file) and `:circular-requires`
  (a circular intra-root require, rethrown from `org.clojure/tools.namespace` under
  this same `{:status :failed :reason … :root-lib …}` shape rather than escaping
  raw).

  Once every namespace loads, the root's fresh fingerprint is recorded in the
  generation baselines, so the completed hot bump stops classifying as a C44c
  redefinition and later `sync!`/`reload!` calls pass. Loaded-namespace entries
  hash the exact bytes compiled (`load-source-bytes!`), so a file racing the
  reload can only make the baseline conservative — a later sync refuses, never
  silently accepts code that differs from what loaded. Each successful namespace
  load appends its own record immediately. If a later namespace fails, those
  earlier records remain truthful partial-load evidence, while the all-root
  fingerprint stays unchanged so the outstanding refusal is preserved.

  Returns a data-first map naming the root lib, its resolved canonical root, and
  the namespaces reloaded with their source files."
