  "Built-in `help` op wiring and the canonical help-envelope projection.

  This surface is core, not alpha: it owns the reserved help-alias token check
  (`help-alias-result`), the canonical help projection (`op-envelope`,
  `verb-envelope`, `op-catalog`), the built-in `help` op handler
  (`op-help-handler`), and its registrar (`register-built-in-ops!`). It lives in
  core because both `skein.api.weaver.alpha` (the alias check inside `op!`) and
  `skein.core.weaver.socket` (invoke-path dispatch) consume `help-alias-result`,
  and core must not require an alpha namespace.

  Help is not hand-authored: it is one declared, versioned schema, uniformly
  projected (SPEC-002.C39, DELTA-Dtf-001.D1). Every response is the response
  envelope `{schema-version, operation, source, glossary, node}` (the no-arg
  catalog is the same schema family, `{schema-version, ops[]}`), and `node` is
  the uniform fractal node (`{name, doc, invocation, returns, hook-class,
  deadline-class, use-when, notes, failure-modes, children}`) at every depth,
  recursing to the arg-spec's declared depth. `hook-class`/`deadline-class` are
  node keys with per-kind null semantics (DELTA-Lhc-003.CC1): class strings on
  an invocable leaf node (a flat or raw-envelope op's root node is its leaf —
  from the leaf's declared metadata or, in this accretive slice, the op-entry
  fallback), `null` on interior nodes and subcommand-op roots. The projection
  normalizes today's registry data — the op envelope, the arg-spec `explain`
  (SPEC-003.C64/C65), and the per-case return-shape `explain` (SPEC-003.C60b)
  — into that schema; nothing here re-models or hand-writes usage.

  `source` is the op-wide handler pointer resolved best-effort at projection
  (DELTA-Dtf-002.CC2): `requiring-resolve` under the runtime spool classloader,
  then the resolved var's `:file`/`:line` mapped to a readable on-disk path, or
  `null` in the three best-effort cases. `glossary` is the referenced-term closure
  of the returned subtree, resolved once against the runtime glossary
  (DELTA-Dtf-002.CC5). The load graph pins its other reaches:
  `skein.core.weaver.access` requires the runtime and socket namespaces back to
  this one, so both the op-registry and glossary-registry reads use the runtime
  map's keys directly, and everything below `access` in the graph can
  only reach it and the alpha module dynamically — the `requiring-resolve` calls
  here (`register-op!`, `resolve-op`, the handler pointer, and
  `access/with-spool-classloader`) are call-time reaches into the public surface,
  the same idiom the socket transport uses for `op!`.

  Every `help` invocation renders through the registered default help transform
  when one is present, else emits the raw canonical envelope (DELTA-Dtf-001.CC4).
  The transform is the runtime-owned at-most-one slot
  (`skein.api.runtime.help-transform.alpha`), read here off the runtime map's
  `:help-transform-slot` key directly — the blessed accessor sits above this
  namespace in the load graph, like the op- and glossary-registry reads. It
  receives the full envelope and returns the string the CLI relays; a throwing
  transform fails loudly naming it (never a silent fallback, TEN-003), and
  `--json` always bypasses the slot so a broken transform never bricks help.
  `about`/`prime` output is never transformed.

  Besides the `help` catalog/detail projection, this namespace owns the two
  builtin arity-1 meta-verbs `about` and `prime` (DELTA-Dtf-002.CC6): each
  resolves one op and returns its declared `:about`/`:prime` prose beside the same
  op-wide `source`, failing loudly on missing prose or a verb path."

  op class (flat, subcommand, and raw-envelope). It resolves to the SAME node as

  envelope, and verb tokens before the flag narrow it to the node that path
  names, composing to any declared depth (DELTA-Lhc-002.CC6) — a token naming
  no child fails loudly with the canonical error context, so `spool add <url>
  --help` fails naming `add`'s children as none, never silently parsing. Both

  rewrite is a read-class projection and the target op's mutating hooks never
  fire.

  Everything else is not a rewrite. The bare word `help`/`about`/`prime` in verb
  position is the retired `<op> help`/`about`/`prime` sugar (TEN-000@1) and fails
  with the loud redirect to `strand help <op>` — unless the op declares a real

  legitimate argument and flows to normal parsing). Any other `--help`/`-h` shape
  (a non-final flag, another flag alongside it, or attached payloads) likewise
  fails with the loud redirect rather than reaching a handler; on raw-envelope
  ops this is the only guard, since they parse no arg-spec. A shape with no
  `--help`/`-h` and no retired verb returns nil and flows through normal parsing.

  Supersedes SPEC-004.C63e's subcommand-only sole-token alias. `help`/`-h`/
  `--help` remain reserved subcommand names (`help-flag-tokens` derives from
  `skein.api.cli.alpha/reserved-subcommand-names`), so the rewrite shadows
