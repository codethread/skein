(ns skein.core.weaver.core-registry
  "Owner-partition backing for the five core weaver registries.

  CLI ops, named queries, weave patterns, lifecycle hooks, and event handlers
  each become one kind declared on an `owner-registry` kernel. Every declaration
  is owned by a stable keyword owner in a fixed layer (`:defaults < :spools <
  :workspace < :direct`); replacing an owner partition is complete, so an
  omitted key disappears, and cross-owner collisions or missing override intent
  fail before the atom changes.

  A `store` is `{:kind <kind-id> :kernel <owner-registry-atom>}`. Readers derive
  one immutable effective map from the kernel snapshot they capture; there is no
  second projection atom to keep in sync.

  Direct per-entry writes carry an explicit owner. The system owner contributes
  in the defaults layer and every other direct owner contributes in the direct
  layer. Owner-complete replacement and removal are the sharp tools the module
  contribution path reuses without forking these semantics."
