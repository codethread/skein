  "Resolve, validate, and bootstrap def-spool entry points for the coordinator.

  A narrow data-first seam for the module-refresh orchestration story. Given a
  module key, its Phase A declaration, and the namespace that owns its `spool`
  var, `resolve-entry-points` returns the effective `{:contribute sym :reconcile
  sym}`: explicit declaration keys win per key, absent fields are filled from the
  namespace's public `spool` var validated against `::spool`, and unqualified
  entry-point symbols are qualified against the declaring namespace. `resolve-fn!`
  turns a resolved entry-point symbol into the fn value its Var holds, failing
  loudly otherwise; `legacy-resolved-entry-points` bootstraps the retained set
  from pre-Phase-A coordinator state so live pickup still tears down."
