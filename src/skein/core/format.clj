  "Implementation of `|`-margin doc-block reflowing shared across tiers.

  Long prose authored in source (op payloads, `about` surfaces, config rule
  descriptions) reads best as one `|`-margin string: the bar marks column 0,
  plain newlines soft-wrap, a bare `|` line separates items, and indentation
  past the bar is preserved verbatim for command samples and other intentional
  layout. This is the single implementation; the blessed consumer surface is
  `skein.api.format.alpha`, and `skein.spools.format` keeps the documented
  spool-authoring names."

  "Reflow a `|`-margin doc block into a vector of item strings.

  Each line's content is whatever follows its first `|`, so the bar marks
  column 0 and the enclosing form may be indented freely. A bare `|` line
  separates items. Within an item, flush-left lines are prose soft-wrapped into
  a single line; if any line is indented past the bar the whole item is kept
  verbatim, so command samples and other intentional layout survive. Prose is
  the zero-marker default; indentation is what supplies structure. Throws when
  no line carries a bar — a bar-less block is an authoring error, not empty
