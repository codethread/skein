  "Explicit-runtime vocabulary registry: the blessed home for declaring and
  reading Skein's attribute-namespace and edge-type vocabulary.

  Every seed and consumer module `declare!`s the attribute namespaces and edge
  types it owns and reads the whole picture back, so the vocabulary a strand
  graph actually uses is discoverable data instead of tribal knowledge. A
  declaration is a small map (`:kind`, `:name`, `:owner`, `:doc`, plus `:keys`
  for an attribute namespace or `:family`/`:direction`/`:declared-acyclic?` for
  an edge). The registry is runtime-owned per-spool state that survives
  `reload!`, versioned so a shape change cannot silently reuse a stale map, and
  seeded at init with the reflected `relations.alpha` edge catalog plus the
  core-owned `note/*` attribute namespace.

  Callers own runtime selection and pass the target weaver runtime as the first
  argument, per the blessed-namespace convention; nothing here reads the
  published ambient runtime."
