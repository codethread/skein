  "Explicit-runtime cross-spool note primitive: the blessed writer and reader
  for strand memory.

  A note is an immutable, born-closed strand (memory, not work) linked to its
  target by an outgoing `notes` annotation edge. `note!` writes that strand and
  edge; `notes` walks the incoming `notes` edges to a target and projects each
  note in `note/at` order. The link is the edge alone — no `note/for` attribute
  — so a target's deletion cascades the edge and the note becomes unreachable
  through the read with no dangling pointer, and every writer that uses this
  primitive is visible to every reader regardless of the decorating attributes a
  caller layers on its notes.

  Callers own runtime selection and pass the target weaver runtime as the first
  argument, per the blessed-namespace convention."
