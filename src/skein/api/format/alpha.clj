  Long strings in source hurt readability and IDE viewports; author them as
  `|`-margin blocks instead and reflow with these helpers. Both helpers
  validate their input against the promised qualified spec key
  `:skein.api.format.alpha/block` — a string in which at least one line
  carries a `|` — and fail loudly with the offending value in ex-data."
