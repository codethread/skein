;; The Clock capability is a plain map of two functions, deliberately not a
;; `defprotocol`. Re-evaluating a `defprotocol` mints a fresh backing interface,
;; so every clock the runtime already holds (its installed clock, any manual
;; clock, a clock mid-poll) stops satisfying the new protocol after a hot
;; reload. A validated map has no generated interface: it stays valid across a
;; reload of this namespace and grows new optional keys without breaking a
;; frozen method set. Build one with `clock`; read it through `now`/`sleep!`.
