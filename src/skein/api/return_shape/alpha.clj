  "Pure declarations and checks for weaver operation return values.

  Return shapes are finite EDN data: JSON scalars, `[:nullable <scalar>]`
  over the non-null scalars (`:string`, `:integer`, `:number`, `:boolean`),
  closed `{:type :map ...}` declarations, and homogeneous
  `{:type :collection ...}` sequences. Registry routing may wrap a shape in
  `:subcommands` or `:stream` declarations; a routed `:subcommands` tree
  mirrors the arg-spec's fractal node tree to any depth — an interior return
  node is `{:subcommands {<name> <node> ...}}` and a leaf return node is a
  return case (DELTA-Lhc-001.CC4). This namespace has no registry or runtime
  state. Failures are `ex-info` whose data carries the published marker
  `:skein.api.return-shape.alpha/error`, a `:reason` keyword, and shape-local
  context such as `:path`."
