(defn apply!
  "Apply one transactional batch graph mutation payload to `runtime`.

  The payload is a map of `:refs` (unqualified non-blank keyword -> existing
  strand id), `:strands`
  (patches keyed by `:ref`), `:edges` (ordered edge ops between refs), and
  `:burn` (refs to burn); `skein.core.db/normalize-batch-payload!` is the
  grammar authority and rejects malformed payloads loudly.

  An `:edges` entry is one of two closed ops. `{:op :upsert ...}` carries
  `:from`, `:to`, `:type`, and optional `:attributes`; it inserts a missing
  edge or replaces attributes on the matching `(from, to, type)` edge, and
  either endpoint may be a ref created earlier in the same payload.
  `{:op :remove ...}` carries exactly `:from`, `:to`, and `:type` — no
  `:attributes`, no other keys — and deletes that exact `(from, to, type)`
  edge; both endpoints must be top-level pre-bound `:refs`, never a ref
  created earlier in the payload. A remove whose exact edge is absent — a
  wrong direction or wrong relation type included — fails loudly and rolls the
  whole batch back. Edge ops execute in submitted `:edges` order inside the
  one transaction, so an ordered `:remove` then `:upsert` of one identity is a
  deterministic program.

  Each returned edge outcome is one transition with exactly `:op`, `:from`,
  `:to`, `:type`, `:before`, and `:after`. `:from` and `:to` are the submitted
  local refs and `:type` the submitted relation text; `:before` and `:after`
  are each `nil` or a normalized edge row with `:from_strand_id`,
  `:to_strand_id`, `:edge_type`, and a decoded-map `:attributes` — durable ids
  and the full attribute map, never storage JSON. An upsert carries its
  pre-image (or `nil` when the edge is new) in `:before` and the written row
  in `:after`; a remove carries the removed row in `:before` and `nil` in
  `:after`. There is no `:edge` alias. The result `:edges`, the
  `:batch/apply-before-commit` hook's `:batch/edge-ops`, and the
  `:batch/applied` event's `:batch/edges` are equal ordered transition
  vectors.

  Normalizes strand attributes through the `:attributes/normalize` transform
  hooks, persists the batch atomically, runs the `:batch/apply-before-commit`
  validation gate inside the transaction, then enqueues the batch event
  followed by the per-strand created/updated/burned fanout.

  The published shapes are the `::normalized-payload` grammar (whose `::edge-op`
  is the closed `::upsert-edge`/`::remove-edge` alternative) and the `::result`
  contract (whose `:created`/`:updated`/`:burned` entries are the closed
  `::strand-row`/`::updated-row`/`::burned-row` shapes and whose `:edges` are
  `::edge-transition`s over `::edge-row`s). Every published map boundary is
  closed: an unexpected key at the payload or result top level, on an edge row,
  or on a lifecycle entry fails loudly at the seam.
  `skein.core.db/normalize-batch-payload!` stays the grammar authority for
  malformed public input, rejecting it with detailed errors; apply! then
  consults `::normalized-payload` on that authority's output, and `::result` on
  the transactional engine's output before the pre-commit hook, events, and
  return. Those two seam checks only catch impossible drift and never weaken the
  authority's rejections."
