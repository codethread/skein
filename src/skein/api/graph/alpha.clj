  "Explicit-runtime API for the named-query registry, query selection, strand
  hydration, graph traversal, and burn.

  This namespace owns the blessed named-query registry surface and its
  validation, ad hoc and registered query id selection, strand hydration by
  id, relation-scoped traversal, edge adjacency, and burn with its pre-commit
  gate and event fanout — and reads in that order. The query compiler lives
  in `skein.core.query`, the SQL engine in `skein.core.db`, and the shared
  lifecycle and dispatch plumbing in `skein.core.weaver.*`.

  Callers own runtime selection and pass the target weaver runtime as the
