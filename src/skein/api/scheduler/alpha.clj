(ns skein.api.scheduler.alpha
  "Explicit-runtime API for the weaver-owned no-poller scheduler primitive.

  A weaver owns one durable clock trigger: trusted code persists a wake keyed
  by a stable caller key, an absolute instant, and a fully qualified handler
  symbol, and the runtime re-arms and dispatches it through the weaver's
  shared serialized async lane so clock-triggered handlers and post-commit
  event handlers observe one mutation order (RFC-009, DELTA-weaver-scheduler-
  repl-001). Delivery is at-least-once: handlers must be idempotent.

  This namespace validates the wake against the shared
  `:skein.core.specs/scheduler-wake` boundary spec (the persistence seam
  consults the same spec) and resolves handlers eagerly, so a bad wake or
  handler fails `schedule!`, not dispatch; durable storage lives in
  `skein.core.db`, and timer arming/dispatch in
  `skein.core.weaver.scheduler`. Persisted rows return as decoded
  data-first maps (`::pending-wake`, `::cancellation`).

  Pull-based `wake-at` strand attributes plus named queries remain the
  default answer when a poller already exists. Reach for this namespace only
  for the no-poller case where something must proactively happen at instant T
  with no client polling to trigger it.

  Callers own runtime selection and pass the target weaver runtime as the
  first argument to every function here; capture it with
  `skein.api.current.alpha/runtime` only at trusted entry points."
