  "Structural validation plumbing for declarative CLI arg-specs.

  Validates the fractal node tree recursively (DELTA-Lhc-001.CC1/CC2): a node
  declaring `:subcommands` is an interior node and may not carry
  `:flags`/`:positionals` or leaf class metadata; any other node is a leaf and
  may declare `:hook-class`/`:deadline-class` beside its flags and positionals.
  Structural failures at depth carry the canonical path context — `:op` (string)
  and `:path` (the node path from the root, `[]` at the root) — per
  DELTA-Lhc-001.CC3."
