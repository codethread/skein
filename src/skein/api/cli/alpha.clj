  "Blessed declarative argv parser for weaver ops (SPEC-003-D003.C1/C2).

  An arg-spec is minimal EDN data (no functions) describing an op's flags and
  positionals. `parse` turns an envelope's argv plus attached payloads into a
  data map of keyword arg names to parsed values, or throws a loud structured
  `ex-info`. `explain` renders the same arg-spec as JSON-safe help data for the
  `help <op>` projection. The namespace is pure: no registry, socket, or runtime
  coupling and no module-level state.

  An arg-spec is a fractal node tree (DELTA-Lhc-001.CC1). A **leaf** node
  declares no `:subcommands`; its `:flags`/`:positionals` are optional (a
  doc-only leaf is valid) and it may carry `:hook-class`/`:deadline-class`
  metadata as peers of `:doc` (DELTA-Lhc-001.CC2):

    {:op <keyword-or-string> ; optional, echoed into errors and help
     :doc <string>           ; optional summary
     :hook-class :read | :mutating          ; optional leaf metadata
     :deadline-class :standard | :unbounded ; optional leaf metadata
     :flags {<name-kw> <flag-spec>}
     :positionals [<positional-spec> ...]} ; trailing may be variadic

  An **interior** node instead declares `:subcommands`, mapping non-blank name
  strings to nested nodes of the same shape at any depth; it may not also
  declare `:flags`/`:positionals` or class metadata, and an empty
  `:subcommands {}` is invalid:

    {:op <keyword-or-string>
     :doc <string>
     :subcommands {<name-string> <node> ...}}

  Parsing a subcommand arg-spec routes on argv tokens recursively: each token
  selects a child node until a leaf is reached, and the remaining argv parses
  against the leaf. The result merges the leaf's parsed args with `:subcommand`
  bound to the full routing path as a vector of name strings (always a vector,
  at every depth; DELTA-Lhc-001.CC3). Missing or unknown routing tokens — and
  structural failures at depth — carry the canonical error context: `:op`
  (string), `:path` (tokens successfully walked, `[]` at the root), `:token`
  (the offending token, nil when missing), and `:available` (child names at the
  failing node). The names in `reserved-subcommand-names` and the `subcommand`
  arg name are rejected at every level.

  A flag-spec is a map with:

    :type      :string | :int | :boolean | :boolean-token | :map
               - :string/:int/:boolean-token consume a typed value
               - :boolean is a presence form (`--flag` -> true, no value)
               - :map accumulates `--flag key=value` tokens into a map
    :repeat?   truthy -> repeatable, values collect into a vector
    :required? truthy -> must appear
    :parse     :json | :jsonl ; parse the resolved string value
    :doc       <string>

  A positional-spec is a map with :name (keyword), :type, :required?,
  :variadic? (trailing only, collects remaining tokens into a vector), :parse,
  and :doc.

  Payload references (SPEC-003-D003.C2): after argv parsing, any whole string
  value equal to `:stdin` or `:payload/<name>` resolves to the matching entry in
  the envelope payloads map. Matching is whole-value only (a value that merely
  contains `:stdin` as a substring is untouched). A reference with no matching
  payload throws; an attached payload that no reference consumed throws.
  Payload references and `:parse` declarations apply unchanged inside every
  nested level."

  forms (`--help`/`-h`) of a trailing token to the `help` op
