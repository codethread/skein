  "Explicit-runtime glossary of named failure outcomes for the discovery surface.

  A glossary outcome maps a qualified, stable name to a short canonical
  definition; the help projection (DELTA-Dtf-002.CC5) resolves per-verb
  `failure-modes` references against this one registry so lifecycle-failure prose
  is defined once and referenced by name, never restated per verb. Each owning
  spool reconciles its outcomes before help resolves the referencing ops (the
  load-order contract, DELTA-Dtf-003.CC2); trusted config may register outcomes
  directly. The registry is runtime-owned service state. Module refresh leaves
  direct entries intact, while an owning module reconciles its complete set.

  Discipline (TEN-000@1, no-migration alpha): outcome names are qualified and
  stable; `register-glossary-outcome!` fails loudly on a name collision, naming
  both registrants, and changed semantics require a **new name**, never a
  redefinition. `replace-glossary-outcome!` is the deliberate override and
  requires the name to already exist.

  Callers own runtime selection and pass the target weaver runtime as the first
  argument; nothing here reads the published ambient runtime."
