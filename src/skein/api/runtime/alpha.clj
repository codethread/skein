(ns skein.api.runtime.alpha
  "Explicit-runtime API for trusted weaver runtime loader/config workflows.

  Callers own runtime selection and pass the target weaver runtime as the first
  argument. Use `skein.api.current.alpha/runtime` only at trusted in-process
  entry points that need to capture the active runtime.

  The module reads as the live-image lifecycle: read the approved/declared
  config (`approved`, `declared`, `release-marker`), edit the primary
  `spools.edn` (`upsert-spool-entry!`, `remove-spool-entry!`), declare stable
  modules (`module!`), collect authoring-form entries from module sources
  (`collect-entry!`), reconcile the running image against them (`refresh!`,
  with `plan` its effect-free dry-run), inspect the joined offline picture
  (`status`), reach for the advanced code-only seam (`reload-code!`), and serve
  runtime-owned state and time to trusted spools (`spool-state`, `clock`, `now`).

  `module!`/`refresh!`/`plan`/`status`/`reload-code!` are the lifecycle surface:
  declarations are data, refresh replaces owner-complete contributions and
  reconciles resources without stopping the live image, and `reload-code!` is
  the sharp code-only tool. Component sub-specs live in
  `skein.api.runtime.internal.shapes`; every registered key stays
  alpha-qualified."

(defn module!
  "Declare one stable runtime module under keyword `key` for `runtime`.

  `opts` conforms to `::module-opts`: it is closed to a source target (`:ns`
  namespace symbol — synced for ordinary source-loading declarations — or
  workspace-relative `:file` string; exactly one is required), an optional
  `:load :image` mode, optional approved `:spools` root prerequisites,
  optional module-key `:after` dependencies, and an optional boolean
  `:required?`.

  Entry points follow the `def spool` convention (PROP-Dsp-001): the module's
  namespace declares a public `(def spool {:contribute … :reconcile …})` var
  whose symbols the coordinator resolves at every module evaluation. During
  Phase A the legacy explicit `:contribute`/`:reconcile` opt keys remain
  accepted and win per key over the `spool` var; a target with no `spool` var
  works from a complete explicit declaration. When neither the resolved
  `:contribute` nor an explicit one is present, the module's contribution is the
  declaration data collected from the authoring forms evaluated in its source,
  so a plain file of authoring forms is a complete module
  (DELTA-OlrRepl-001.CC3). A `spool` var supplying `:contribute` while the same
  source load collected authoring forms is a loud conflict; a legacy explicit
  `:contribute` retains its Phase A behavior, and a `:reconcile`-only `spool`
  var composes with authoring forms.

  `:load :image` (SPEC-004.C45/C46, ADR-003.P4) trusts the
  already-loaded JVM image for the `:ns` target: refresh performs no source
  load for that module, and it accepts no `:file` target — that violation is
  refused at declaration time. Its entry points resolve from the namespace's
  `spool` var (or an explicit `:contribute`) in the image; a declared namespace
  not loaded in the image, or one with no resolvable `:contribute`, is that
  module's `:failed` outcome at evaluation. The outcome reports
  `:source/status :image` and carries no source stamp.

  A `:reconcile` fn receives the contribution status under
  `[:module/contribution :status]` and branches: `:applied` ensures its live
  resources and registrations exist, `:removed` tears them down, and any other
  status — reachable only by direct call — fails loudly naming the status, the
  allowed set, the module, and the reconciler (SPEC-004.C46b).

  During startup-file collection this only stages the declaration and performs
  no source load, publication, or reconcile. Outside collection it replaces the
  desired declaration for `key` and refreshes that module plus affected
  dependents (CC4). Whole-module removal is expressed by omitting the module
  from a successfully collected full graph, not here. Malformed declarations
  fail loudly. The staged or refreshed result conforms to `::module-result`."

  collection the form is passive, so a code-only source reload defines Vars

(defn spool-state
  "Return runtime-owned state for a spool key, creating it with `init-fn` once.

  The runtime stores spool state under arbitrary keys in its `:spool-state`
  atom. `init-fn` is called only when `key` has not been installed for this
  runtime; the returned value is then reused for the rest of the runtime
  lifetime. Spools should use this accessor instead of reaching into runtime
  internals.

  Spool state survives `refresh!` by design, so a spool whose state shape changed
  between refreshes would otherwise silently reuse a preserved value that is
  missing the new keys. The four-arg arity guards against that: pass opts
  `{:version v :migrate-fn f}` and, when a preserved value's stored version does
  not `=` `version`, the runtime deliberately reinits (or, with `:migrate-fn`,
  hands the old value to `f` to produce the new one) instead of reusing a
  shape-mismatched map. Silent reuse of shape-mismatched state is impossible
  once a version is declared. Opts conform to
  `:skein.api.runtime.alpha/spool-state-opts`; a malformed map fails loudly at
  the call site rather than degrading to the unversioned path."
