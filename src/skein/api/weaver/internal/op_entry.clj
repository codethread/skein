  "Registration-time validation and entry construction for weaver CLI ops.

  Plumbing behind `skein.api.weaver.alpha`'s `register-op!`/`replace-op!`: it
  normalizes the metadata argument, validates the structural fields, checks
  returns/arg-spec routing alignment, and assembles the registry entry with
  derived provenance and metadata defaults. These are plain public defns on an
  internal tier (SPEC-005.C5b); the alpha module composes them into its
  registration story and owns the reaches into the `skein.api.cli.alpha` and
  `skein.api.return-shape.alpha` contracts (an internal namespace never
  requires an alpha namespace, SPEC-003.C19a), so everything here is
  tier-free: only clojure and `skein.core.*`."
