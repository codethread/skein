  "Blessed owner-partitioned registry primitive for spool domains.

  A spool domain with its own replaceable declarations — chime rules,
  workflow constructors, harness aliases, and the like — declares each
  definition family as a *kind* and then publishes complete owner
  partitions under it. Declaring a kind (id, entry spec, binding-moment
  datum, and the fixed layer policy) makes it a valid contribution-map key
  the refresh kernel publishes uniformly with the core kinds
  (DELTA-OlrRepl-001.CC5/CC13); an undeclared kind is refused loudly before
  publication.

  The primitive is deletion-complete and effect-free: replacing an owner
  partition removes every key the owner omits, cross-owner collisions and
  missing override intent fail before the atom changes, and readers keep the
  immutable snapshot they started with. Baseline seeding, durable writes, and
  other lifecycle effects stay in the domain's own API around the calls here
  — this namespace never runs domain callbacks.

  A registry handle is runtime-owned, not a module singleton: create it once
  inside a `skein.api.runtime.alpha/spool-state` init-fn and reuse the handle
  for the runtime's lifetime. The handle is a metadata-carrying value so
  versioned spool-state can stamp and re-init it across reloads. The storage
  kernel lives in `skein.core.weaver.owner-registry`; every registered key
  here stays alpha-qualified."
