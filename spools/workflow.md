## 1. Overview

`skein.spools.workflow` is a Clojure-native workflow layer built on ordinary Skein strands, edges, and batch mutations. It lets spool authors define small workflow molecules that agents can execute one step at a time without needing to understand the underlying graph engine.

This is userland spool code, not a separate scheduler or persistence system. Workflows compile into normal strand graphs, and runtime state remains inspectable through the usual Skein REPL/graph helpers. The spool owns no privileged runtime state.

Core primitives: `workflow`, `step`, `gate`, `checkpoint`, `call`, `param`, `compile`, `pour!`, `wisp!`, and `explain`.

The generic runtime API is `start!`, `ready`, `ready-step`, `ready-gates`, `ready-checkpoint`, `complete!`, `choose!`, `advance!`, `choice-detail`, `choice-details`, and `done?`, keyed by `workflow/run-id`. Routing targets can be registered under stable names with `register-workflow!`/`workflow-definition`/`workflows` (see §5). Higher-level spools such as `ct.spools.devflow` should define opinionated workflow definitions and thin convenience wrappers around this namespace.

Every run-mutating op (`start!`, `complete!`, `choose!`, `advance!`) returns one `{:ready [step-view ...] :done boolean}` map: `:ready` is the run's ready step views (as `ready` would return them) and `:done` is its done-ness, so an empty `:ready` never leaves a caller guessing whether the run finished or merely stalled. The pure queries `ready`/`ready-step` still return step views directly.

## 2. Credit

Terminology — molecule, wisp, pour, bond, squash, burn, and the proto-like workflow-definition-as-data pattern — borrows heavily from [beads](https://github.com/steveyegge/beads) by Steve Yegge (see `docs/MOLECULES.md` in that repo).

What skein does differently: workflow definitions are Clojure-native data (functions and maps) instead of TOML formulas, and `compile` turns that data into ordinary skein strands and edges rather than a separate issue-tracker schema. There is no proto/template storage layer — a workflow definition *is* the reusable template, expressed as a Clojure function or map.

## 3. Definition layer

### Builders

| Builder | Returns |
|---|---|
| `(param & opts)` | A param definition map. Supports `:required true` and `:default v`. |
| `(step id title waiter & opts)` | A step definition map. `waiter` must be `:self` — a step is always driven-agent-owned; any other value fails loudly, directing the caller to `gate`. Opts: `:depends-on`, `:attributes`, `:condition`, `:loop`, `:description`, `:state`. |
| `(gate id title waiter & opts)` | A step marked `workflow/gate <waiter>` as an external wait point. `waiter` is a freeform actor hint (`:ci`, `:human`, `:subagent`, …), not `:self`. Same opts as `step`. See "Gates" below. |
| `(checkpoint id title & opts)` | A step definition with checkpoint metadata. `:kind` (`:human` or `:agent`, default `:human`), `:choices`. |
| `(call id procedure params & opts)` | An inline procedure-reuse step. `:depends-on`, `:title`, `:attributes`. |
| `(workflow name & body)` | A workflow definition: `{:name .. :steps [..]}` plus optional leading opts map (`:params`, `:attributes`, `:state`, `:phase`). |

`name`, `title`, `description`, and attribute values may be plain values or functions of the resolved params map — resolution happens once, after `:params` defaults/required-checks and caller `params` are merged.

Builders reject unknown option keys loudly: passing a mistyped key (`:require`, `:depend-on`, and similar typos) to `param`, `step`, `gate`, `checkpoint`, `call`, a choice map, or the `workflow` leading-opts map fails with the offending keys and the allowed set in the ex-data.

### Conditions

A step's `:condition` gates inclusion at compile time:

- keyword `:k` — truthy when `(get params :k)` is truthy
- `[:= :k v]` — equality against a resolved param
- `[:!= :k v]` — inequality against a resolved param

Excluded steps are dropped from the compiled strand set entirely.

### Condition splicing (dependency integrity)

After loop/call expansion and condition filtering, `compile` validates every `:depends-on` ref:

- a ref pointing at a step excluded by `:condition` is **spliced**: the
  dependent inherits the excluded step's own `:depends-on`, transitively
  (matching beads' `parent-child` fan-through behavior) — so removing a
  conditional step never leaves a dangling dependency or a false blocker.
- a ref that never existed (typo, or a step that was never defined) fails
  loudly with `{:step .. :missing ..}`.
- a step `:id` equal to the compiled root ref (default `:molecule`, or
  `opts :root-ref`) fails loudly rather than silently colliding with the
  root strand.

### Loops

`:loop` on a step expands it into one strand per item. Expansion runs **after** params are resolved, so loops see the full workflow param map:

- **Render env.** Each expanded step's fn-valued `title`/`description`/
  `attributes` is rendered against `(merge params {:item item :i idx})` — the
  per-iteration `:item` and its 0-based index `:i`, layered over the workflow
  params (so a loop step still sees `:feature` and the like).
- **`:each` forms.** `{:each xs}` where `xs` is a literal sequential, a keyword
  naming a resolved param, or a fn of the resolved params map returning a
  sequential. A param value or fn result that is not sequential **fails loudly**.
- **`:count`.** `{:count n}` expands over items `1..n` unchanged.
- **Id suffix** (`base-id-<suffix>`): the number for `:count`; `(:id item)`
  when the item is a map carrying `:id`; otherwise the item's 1-based position.
- **Chain.** Add `:chain true` to make expansion `i` depend on expansion `i-1`;
  expansion 0 keeps the step's declared `:depends-on`. `{:count n :chain true}`
  chains `base-1 -> base-2 -> ...`; `{:each xs :chain true}` uses the same id
  suffix rules as non-chained loops.
- **Fan-in.** Another step's `:depends-on` naming the **base** loop id (the
  pre-expansion id) is rewritten to depend on **all** expanded ids for that
  loop, even when the loop is chained. This keeps one base-id rule: a downstream
  step can wait on the loop as a whole. Refs naming a genuinely unknown id still
  fail ref validation (see condition splicing above).

Conditions on loop steps are evaluated against the workflow params only (not `:item`/`:i`) and therefore include or exclude the whole loop uniformly. Excluded loop copies are spliced like any other step, so base-id dependents reattach through condition splicing.

### The `:self` doctrine

Every step declares who owns getting it done, and the runtime tolerates exactly two answers: `:self` (the driving agent, via `step`) or a named external `waiter` (via `gate`). `step` **requires** its third positional argument to be the literal `:self` and fails loudly on anything else, directing the caller to `gate` instead — there is never a step with a named-but-unenforced owner. A `:self` step carries no `workflow/gate` attribute, so its compiled strand is identical to a bare step; `:self` exists to make ownership explicit at the call site, not to add runtime state.

### Gates — external wait points

The runtime is pull-based and *every* strand is already a durable wait point: an external actor (CI, cron, a sub-agent, another session) can close a strand through the ordinary surface and the run resumes on the next `ready` poll. A **gate** just marks a step "not yours to complete — wait for `<waiter>`", so a driving agent can tell work-steps from wait-steps.

```clojure
(workflow/gate :ci-green "Wait for CI to go green" :ci :depends-on [:push])
```

- `(gate id title waiter & opts)` returns an ordinary step (role stays
  `"step"`, so done-semantics are untouched) stamped with `workflow/gate
  <waiter>`. `waiter` is a freeform actor hint — keyword, symbol, or non-blank
  string such as `:ci`, `:human`, `:subagent`, … — stored as a string; it
  carries no engine semantics. `:self` is rejected because inline-driver work
  belongs in `step`.
- `step-view` surfaces it as `:gate "<waiter>"`, so the driving agent should
  treat a ready gate as **poll/hand off, don't do**.
- The external actor closes the gate via `complete!` with a `:by`:
  `(workflow/complete! run-id {:step gate-id :by "ci"})`. `complete!` **refuses
  to close a gate without `:by`** (fails loudly) and records `:by` as
  `workflow/outcome-by` on the closed step. Raw `repl/update!` remains the
  trusted escape hatch (TEN-002) for closing any strand directly.
- `register-executor!` (§4 "Awaiting attention") keys a stall predicate by a
  gate's `waiter` name, so an adapter that fulfills a whole waiter class of
  gates can make `await!` stay silent while it is healthy. A gate whose
  waiter has no registered executor always surfaces immediately — there is no
  silent default.
- An external adapter, `ct.spools.executors.subagent`, fulfills ready
  `:subagent` gates by spawning agent-run runs, registers the `:subagent`
  executor, and closes each gate with the run's result. See
  [its contract][subagent-contract].
- A shipped classpath executor, `skein.spools.executors.shell`, fulfills ready `:shell`
  gates by running the gate's `shell/argv` command directly, registers the
  `:shell` executor, and closes each gate with `complete!` on a zero exit
  (stamping a loud `gate/error` otherwise). See `executors/shell.md`.

**Dynamic fan-out needs no primitive.** The run subgraph is recomputed live from the graph on every poll, so userland may add strands to a running molecule mid-flight — ordinary `strand!` plus `parent-of`/`depends-on` edges to the run's root — to spawn e.g. sub-agent steps discovered at runtime. Set `workflow/role "step"` on them so they count as workflow work and gate the run's done-check exactly like poured steps.

### Tool bindings — forge-agnostic definitions

The engine never executes; the driving agent interprets ready-step data. So a workflow that touches external tools (a git forge, CI, a deploy target) should never name the tool. Instead:

- Steps carry a semantic `workflow/action-ref` name (`"pr.ci.wait"`), and
  the concrete command arrives through `workflow/instruction`.
- The definition fn accepts a **bindings map** — action-ref → binding map —
  as pure data through its params, shipping one tool's bindings as the
  default reference. A user rebinds any subset from trusted config by
  deep-merging over the reference (`merge-with merge`) — per-step,
  per-field granularity — and definitions never change. The binding field
  vocabulary (e.g. `:instruction`, `:skills`) belongs to the workflow
  author's mapping table, which fails loudly on unbound actions and unknown
  keys (TEN-003); the engine anticipates nothing.
- **Round-trip note:** bindings ride `workflow/context` across routed loop
  rounds. The JSON layer keywordizes map keys on read and writes keyword
  keys with their full `ns/name` form (`skein.core.db/json-key`), so keyword keys
  round-trip faithfully. Binding keys conventionally stay simple
  (`:pr.ci.wait`, `:instruction`), and the definition maps them onto the
  canonical string attribute vocabulary (`"workflow/instruction"`) when
  building step attributes.

The pull-request model in `test/skein/spools/workflow_test.clj` (`workflow-pr-flow-rebinds-forge-without-spool-changes`) is the reference for this pattern: GitHub bindings shipped as defaults, GitLab swapped in as a partial user override, identical definitions. A weaver-side action registry (resolving action-ref names over the socket for CLI-grade drivers) is a possible future layer; it is intentionally not built yet.

## 4. Run lifecycle

```
start! ──▶ ready / ready-step ──▶ complete! / choose! ──▶ (repeat) ──▶ auto-close
```

- `(start! run-id workflow params opts)` — fails if `run-id` already has an
  active root; pours the workflow with `workflow/run-id run-id`; returns the
  `{:ready [...] :done boolean}` result. `workflow` may be a pre-built map, a
  constructor var (`#'my.ns/flow`), or a registered workflow keyword. Var/keyword
  starts derive `:definition`; when `:context` is absent they default it from
  `params`, stringifying keyword values and failing loudly on non-JSON-safe
  values (pass `:context` explicitly for those cases).
- `(ready run-id)` / `(ready run-id selector)` — all currently ready,
  agent-facing step views for the run (vector, possibly empty). Each view carries
  `:run-id` so a stage cutover is visible in-band; procedure join steps never
  appear (see below). The optional selector filters by view keys such as `:role`,
  `:gate`, `:checkpoint`, or `:checkpoint-kind`.
- `(ready-step run-id)` — convenience wrapper that throws if more than one
  step is ready; use `ready`, `ready-gates`, or `ready-checkpoint` for workflows with parallel entry points
  or fan-out.
- `(ready-gates run-id)` / `(ready-gates run-id waiter)` — ready gate views,
  optionally restricted to one waiter string/keyword such as `:subagent`.
- `(ready-checkpoint run-id)` — the single ready checkpoint view, nil if none,
  or a loud ambiguity failure if more than one checkpoint is ready.
- `(complete! run-id)` / `(complete! run-id opts)` — closes a non-checkpoint
  ready step and returns the `{:ready [...] :done boolean}` result.
- `(choose! run-id choice)` / `(choose! run-id choice input)` /
  `(choose! run-id choice input opts)` — records a checkpoint decision,
  optionally routes to a continuation (`:next`), and returns the
  `{:ready [...] :done boolean}` result. When the chosen choice declares
  required `:input` keys, `choose!` fails loudly before any mutation if they
  are missing (see §5). Revision loops route `:next` back to the same stage
  (see §5).
- `(advance! run-id)` / `(advance! run-id opts)` — one verb that advances the
  run regardless of the ready step's kind, returning the same result shape.
  When the resolved ready step is a checkpoint, `opts` must carry `:choice`
  (and may carry `:input`, default `{}`, plus pass-through `:by`/`:step`) and it
  dispatches to `choose!`; when it is a step, `:choice` must be absent and it
  dispatches to `complete!` with pass-through `:notes`/`:attributes`/`:step`/`:by`.
  Supplying `:choice` on a step, or omitting it on a checkpoint, fails loudly.

### Awaiting attention

`await!` blocks in-process until a run is done or needs its coordinator:

```clojure
(workflow/await! "feat-x" {:timeout-secs 1800})       ; ergonomic: current/runtime
(workflow/await! runtime "feat-x" {:timeout-secs 1800}) ; explicit runtime
```

The three-arg `(runtime run-id opts)` arity threads the target runtime explicitly, agreeing with `roster/await-quiet!`; the shorter arities resolve the ambient `current/runtime` as the ergonomic default.

It returns `{:reason :done|:checkpoint|:step|:gate|:stalled|:timeout :ready [...] :done boolean :detail ...}`. `opts` takes `:timeout-secs` (default 1800) and `:poll-ms` (default 250, matching the agent-run await surface) — there is no predicate to name, because `await!` resolves attention purely from the ready frontier and the executor registry. A negative or non-integer `:timeout-secs`/ `:poll-ms` fails loudly instead of reaching `Thread/sleep`:

- `:done` — the run is finished.
- `:checkpoint` — a checkpoint is ready (any kind wakes the caller).
- `:step` — a ready `:self` step needs the driving agent. This exists so a
  ready step can never bury itself under `:waiting`.
- `:gate` — a ready gate's `waiter` has no registered executor, so someone
  must attend to it directly.
- `:stalled` — a ready gate's `waiter` **does** have a registered executor,
  and its predicate reported detail (the executor believes it needs
  coordinator attention).
- `:waiting` — the whole ready frontier is executor-owned gates whose
  predicates report no detail; nothing to do but keep polling.

Executor registration is keyed by gate `waiter` name via `register-executor!` (a keyword/symbol/non-blank-string matching the `gate` waiter hint, e.g. `:subagent`, never `:self`), mirroring `register-workflow!` as weaver-lifetime runtime state. Invalid waiter values and non-invokable predicates fail at registration time:

```clojure
(workflow/register-executor! :subagent gate-stalled?)   ; pred: ready gate view -> truthy detail | nil
(workflow/executors)                          ; => {:subagent gate-stalled? ...}
```

This keeps the workflow namespace free of any executor's vocabulary: a waiter with no registered
executor always surfaces as `:gate` immediately, and adapters such as the
[external subagent executor][subagent-contract] register their own predicate for their own waiter
name at install time. There is no more named "stall predicate" independent of a waiter, and no
shipped default predicate — `register-stall-predicate!` and the old `:stall-predicate` await option
are gone.

### Procedure join auto-close

A `call` expands to its inner steps plus a `procedure`-role **join** step that depends on the procedure's exit steps (see §3). Joins never surface as ready work: when `complete!`/`choose!` closes the last active inner step beneath a join, the join closes in the same `batch/apply!` transaction (stamped `workflow/outcome-by "engine"` for provenance), and a join that is itself the last inner step of an outer join cascades likewise. Agents therefore never complete a bookkeeping join by hand.

**`complete!` opts** (trailing map, all optional):

- `:step` — materialized strand id, selects which ready step to complete
  when more than one is ready. Without it, single-ready-step behavior
  applies (fails loudly if ambiguous). Validated before any mutation.
- `:notes` — recorded on the closed step as `"workflow/outcome-notes"`.
- `:attributes` — merged onto the closed step's attributes. Molecules exist
  for the audit trail, so closing a step can record what happened.
- `:by` — actor identity, recorded as `"workflow/outcome-by"`. **Mandatory**
  when closing a `gate` step (see §3 "Gates"); ignored on non-gate steps.

**`choose!` opts** (trailing map, all optional):

- `:step` — same selector semantics as `complete!`, also accepted by
  `choice-details`/`choice-detail`.
- `:by` — actor identity, recorded as `"workflow/outcome-by"` on the closed
  checkpoint.

### Auto-close ("done")

A run is **done** iff every strand in the root subgraph with `workflow/role` in `#{"step" "checkpoint" "procedure"}` is `"closed"`. This is checked (and the root closed if true) after every mutation that could finish the run — `start!` (in case a workflow has zero steps), `complete!`, and `choose!`. Procedure joins still count as work that must be closed; the engine's join auto-close (above) is what closes them, not the agent.

This is stricter than "nothing is ready": a step blocked by a userland-added `depends-on`, or a whole run parent-blocked by a `bond!` on its root, does **not** make the run look done, and does not get force-closed. `done?` reflects the same rule and throws (fail loudly) for a `run-id` that has never had a root strand at all.

## 5. Checkpoints and routing

A checkpoint is a step with `workflow/role "checkpoint"`. Use `choose!`, never `complete!`, on a checkpoint.

`:choices` accepts plain keywords (routing is then unavailable) or maps:

```clojure
{:key :approved
 :label "Approve"
 :description "Continue to implementation."
 :next :next-stage            ; a registered name, or a fn symbol
 :input [{:key :reason :required true :description "Why this decision"}]}
```

| Choice map key | Effect |
|---|---|
| `:key` | Choice name (required, unique per checkpoint). |
| `:label`, `:description` | Stored in `workflow/choice-details` for `choice-details`/`choice-detail`. |
| `:next` | Routing target: a **registered workflow name** (keyword, see "Named workflows" below) or a **symbol** naming a 1-arg fn. Resolved at `choose!` time and called with the merged params (see below); its return is compiled as the **continuation** workflow. Mutually exclusive with `:revise`. |
| `:revise` | `{:params {...}}` — re-pour the run's **own** `workflow/definition` with authoritative param overrides (see "`:revise`" below). Mutually exclusive with `:next`; supplying both fails loudly at build time. |
| `:input` | Vector of `{:key :required :description}` maps declaring the choice input this decision expects; unknown declaration keys fail loudly like other builder opts. |

### Named workflows — the routing registry

`:next` may name a workflow registered under a stable keyword instead of a raw fn symbol:

```clojure
(workflow/register-workflow! :spec-plan 'my.ns/spec-plan-workflow)
(workflow/workflow-definition :spec-plan)   ; => 'my.ns/spec-plan-workflow (fails loudly if unknown)
(workflow/workflows)             ; => {:spec-plan 'my.ns/spec-plan-workflow ...}
```

The registry is **weaver-lifetime in-memory state**, re-registered from startup config exactly like named queries and patterns (there is no durable registry storage). A duplicate name **replaces** the prior entry, so reloading a workflow re-points every in-flight run's not-yet-chosen named routes at the new constructor. A `:next` keyword is resolved through the registry at `choose!` time and **fails loudly on an unregistered name**, before any mutation. A routed continuation records the resolved constructor symbol as its own `workflow/definition`, so a later `:revise` at that stage can re-pour it.

### `:input` — declared choice input

A choice may declare the input `choose!` expects as a vector of `{:key kw :required bool :description str}` maps. The declaration is stored JSON-safely under the choice's `workflow/choice-details` entry and surfaced (string-keyed) by `choice-details`/`choice-detail` as `"input"`, so a driving agent can see what a decision needs before making it. Before any mutation, `choose!` fails loudly when a required key is absent from the passed `input` map, carrying the missing keys and the full declaration in the ex-data.

### `:next` — routing to a continuation

The `:next` fn is called with `call-params = (merge workflow/context choice-input)` and may return either:

- a **workflow map** — compiled with `call-params`, which are also persisted as
  the continuation root's `workflow/context`; or
- `{:workflow w :params p}` — `w` is compiled with `p`, and `p` (not
  `call-params`) becomes the continuation root's persisted `workflow/context`.
  This makes the continuation authoritative over its own params: a revision
  round can force `:revision true` regardless of what the caller passed as
  choice input, and start opts carried in `context` flow into the next round's
  params instead of resetting to their defaults.

Choosing a `:next` choice applies **one** transactional `batch/apply!` that, atomically:

- closes the checkpoint, recording the outcome (see attribute table);
- force-closes every remaining active `step`/`checkpoint`/`procedure`/`root`
  strand in the current run's subgraph (existing strands are bound by their
  durable id and updated in place); and
- pours the compiled continuation's new strands and edges under the same
  `run-id`, carrying `family` forward from the current root.

The continuation is compiled once, before any mutation. Folding the checkpoint close, the old-root closes, and the continuation pour into a single transaction means a single active root ever holds the `run-id` (no concurrent `current-root` sees an ambiguous two-root window), and a failed apply commits nothing — the old root and its checkpoint stay active and the run stays resumable rather than being stranded in a false terminal state.

**Warning:** a routed choice closes out the remaining steps of the current workflow. Any step not yet reached when the checkpoint is chosen is abandoned, not paused — routing is a hard cutover to the continuation, not a fork or a merge. If you need work to resume rather than terminate, route to a continuation that re-pours it (see "Loops — revise by routing" below), or design the checkpoint so all prerequisite work is `:depends-on` the checkpoint itself.

**Constraint — durability of routing targets.** A **symbol** `:next` persists a stringified symbol resolved via `requiring-resolve` at `choose!` time, not at compile time; renaming or removing that fn after a run has poured but before its checkpoint is chosen breaks the in-flight run. A **registered-name** `:next` persists the keyword and resolves through the registry at `choose!` time, so re-registering the name (a reload) re-points the run without breaking it — the registry is the indirection layer. Treat a raw fn symbol as part of the in-flight run's durability contract; prefer a registered name for anything that may be renamed or reloaded.

### `:revise` — re-pour the run's own definition

A `:revise {:params {...}}` choice is the declarative revision loop: instead of routing to a named continuation, it re-pours the **run's own** `workflow/definition` under the same `run-id`, with params `(merge context choice-input override-params)` where the `:revise` `:params` are authoritative and persist as the new root's `workflow/context`. It needs no hand-written revision wrapper fn. The run's root must carry a resolvable `workflow/definition` (seed it via start/`opts :definition`, which routed continuations also set for their stage); `:revise` **fails loudly** when it is absent. Same single-transaction cutover as `:next` (see below).

There is no reopen/reactivate mechanism: each round is a **fresh** immutable subgraph poured under the same `run-id`, so the whole loop history stays in the graph, squashable, never mutated in place. A `:condition [:!= :revision true]` gates the work that must not repeat; on a revision round the excluded step drops out and condition splicing (§3) reattaches its dependents, so the round is ready at the first genuinely-repeatable step.

```clojure
(workflow/register-workflow! :spec-plan 'my.ns/spec-plan-workflow)

(defn proposal-workflow [{:keys [revision] :as _opts}]
  (workflow/workflow
    "Proposal"
    {:params {:feature (workflow/param :required true)
              :revision (workflow/param :default (boolean revision))}}
    (workflow/step :inspect-context "Orient" :self
                   :condition [:!= :revision true])   ; skip on revise rounds
    (workflow/step :write-proposal "Write proposal" :self
                   :depends-on [:inspect-context])
    (workflow/checkpoint :signoff "Sign off"
                         :depends-on [:write-proposal]
                         :choices [{:key :approved :next :spec-plan}          ; forward: registered name
                                   {:key :revise :revise {:params {:revision true}}}]))) ; loop: re-pour self
```

### Stage-local override params

`:revise` override params are **stage-local**. The overridden keys are recorded on the re-poured root as `workflow/stage-params`; when a later `:next`/named route leaves the stage, `route-plan` drops those keys from the continuation params. So a `:revision true` forced by a revise round never leaks into a downstream stage's `workflow/context` after the round is approved. Other context values pass through untouched.

A routed `:revise` is an ordinary transactional continuation, so the same "closes out the remaining steps" warning above applies unchanged.

## 6. Molecule ops

| Fn | Effect |
|---|---|
| `(pour! workflow params opts)` | Materializes a persistent molecule strand graph. |
| `(wisp! workflow params opts)` | Materializes an ephemeral wisp strand graph (`workflow/form "wisp"` on the root); userland burns or squashes it explicitly. |
| `(bond! left-id right-id)` | Connects two materialized molecules: `right-id` depends on `left-id`. |
| `(burn! root-id)` | Deletes the molecule/wisp subgraph rooted at `root-id`. |
| `(squash! root-id title attributes)` | Replaces a materialized subgraph with one closed digest strand (`workflow/role "digest"`), then burns the original graph. |
| `(molecule-id result)` | Returns the materialized root id from a `pour!`/`wisp!` result. |

A bond adds a `depends-on` edge (`right-id` depends on `left-id`), stamped `workflow/bond "sequential"` to distinguish it from the intra-molecule dependency edges `compile` emits. A dep-blocked root **parent-blocks its run**: `ready` returns `[]` for the bonded run — its steps stay hidden even though their own deps are satisfied — until the blocking root closes (which the left run's own completion does automatically). Unlike beads, there are no `parallel`/`conditional` bond types: parallelism already falls out of edge *absence* (the ready frontier is the parallel set), and failure-routing belongs in checkpoint choices with `:next` until the runtime grows a failure concept for edges to key off.

## 6a. Describing and archiving

Three read/lifecycle projections let a user (or an agent) inspect a workflow's shape and a run's story without reading source, and fold a finished run into a single digest.

| Fn | Effect |
|---|---|
| `(describe workflow)` / `(describe workflow params)` | Compile-time projection of a workflow definition — **materializes nothing**. |
| `(run-history run-id)` | Read-only, creation-ordered projection of every molecule ever poured for a run. |
| `(squash-run! run-id)` / `(squash-run! run-id {:title .. :attributes ..})` | Squash a finished run's molecules into one closed digest strand. |

### `describe`

`describe` runs the same param resolution, loop/call expansion, and `:condition` filtering as `compile`, then projects the result instead of building strands — so the description matches exactly what would pour for `params`. It returns:

```clojure
{:name "…"
 :steps [{:id :draft :title "Draft widgets" :role "step" :depends-on []
          :condition [:!= :revision true]}
         {:id :signoff :title "Sign off" :role "checkpoint" :depends-on [:refine]
          :choices [{:key "approve" :label "Approve" :next "my.ns/stage-b"}
                    {:key "revise" :label "Revise" :revise {:revision true}
                     :input [{"key" "reason" "required" true "description" "…"}]}]}]}
```

Each step carries `:id`, `:title`, `:role` (`"step"`/`"checkpoint"`/`"procedure"`, so a `call`'s procedure join shows as `:procedure`), and `:depends-on`; a conditioned step adds `:condition`, a gate adds `:gate`, and a checkpoint adds `:choices`. Each choice carries its `:key` plus any declared `:label`, `:description`, `:input` (the D1.2 declaration), and its routing target (`:next` string or `:revise` override-param map). A `:condition`-excluded step is **absent** (its dependents splice through it, §3), so the ready frontier reads straight off the description. `(describe workflow)` resolves param defaults and **fails loudly** listing any required params without a default; pass `params` otherwise.

### `run-history`

`run-history` returns a vector — one entry per molecule ever poured for the run (any state: the active round plus every closed prior round/stage), ordered by molecule `created_at`:

```clojure
[{:root {:id "9i9la" :title "Stage A" :state "closed" :created_at "…"}
  :events [{:type :choice :id "bl4pw" :title "Sign off" :at "…"
            :outcome "revise" :input {:reason "needs work"}}
           {:type :step-closed :id "i1b44" :title "Refine draft" :at "…" :notes "…"}]}
 …]
```

Each event is a **closed** `step` or `checkpoint` strand (procedure joins, being engine bookkeeping, are omitted): a checkpoint is `:choice`, a closed gate is `:gate-closed`, any other step is `:step-closed`. An event carries `:type`, `:id`, `:title`, `:at`, and — when present — `:outcome`, `:by`, `:input`, and `:notes`. Events are ordered by their strand's `updated_at` (`:at`); because that timestamp is second-resolution, events closed in the same transaction (e.g. a routed checkpoint and the steps it force-closes) tie and fall back to strand-id order, so treat within-second event order as unordered. `run-history` writes nothing and **fails loudly** for a run that never had a root strand.

### `squash-run!`

`squash-run!` is the run-level counterpart of `squash!` (§6). It **fails loudly** for an unknown run or one that still has an active root, then replaces every molecule subgraph of the run with **one** closed digest strand (`weaver/add!`, then `burn!` on each molecule) and returns it. The digest is stamped `workflow/role "digest"`, `workflow/run-id`, `workflow/squashed-count` (total strands folded), and a compact JSON-safe `workflow/summary` — one entry per molecule (creation order) with its title and the ordered checkpoint `outcomes`. `opts` may override the digest `:title` and merge extra `:attributes`. As with `squash!`, the original graph is burned, so a later `run-history` for the squashed run fails loudly.

## 7. Attribute vocabulary

This table is the extension API: spools built on top of `skein.spools.workflow` (like `ct.spools.devflow`) read and write these `workflow/*` attributes directly on strands. Unless noted, attributes are plain string-keyed `TEXT`/JSON values on the strand's `:attributes` map.

| Attribute | Meaning | Set by |
|---|---|---|
| `workflow/role` | `"root"`, `"step"`, `"checkpoint"`, `"procedure"`, or `"digest"`. Drives which strands count as workflow work. | `compile` (root/step strands), `expand-call-step` (procedure join step), `squash!` (digest). |
| `workflow/form` | `"molecule"` or `"wisp"`. | `compile`, from `opts :form` (defaults molecule) or `pour!`/`wisp!`. |
| `workflow/run-id` | Stable run handle used by `start!`/`ready`/`complete!`/`choose!`/`current-root`. | `compile`, from `opts :run-id` (root strand only). |
| `workflow/family` | Grouping label across related runs (e.g. `"devflow"`). Carried forward into `:next` continuations. | `compile`, from `opts :family` (root strand only). |
| `workflow/definition` | Stringified symbol naming the workflow definition fn/var; the constructor `:revise` re-pours and that routed continuations record for their stage. | `compile`, from `opts :definition` (root strand only; set by start, `:revise`, and named/symbol `:next` routing). |
| `workflow/context` | Map merged with checkpoint choice input to build `:next`/`:revise` continuation params (also carries revision-loop state forward). | `compile`, from `opts :context` (root strand only); read back by `route-plan`. |
| `workflow/stage-params` | Vector of the stage-local override key names a `:revise` round set; dropped from continuation params when a later `:next` route leaves the stage. | `route-plan` (`:revise`), root strand only. |
| `workflow/gate` | Freeform waiter/actor hint marking a step an external wait point (`"ci"`, `"human"`, `"subagent"`, …). Surfaced by `step-view` as `:gate`; makes `complete!` require `:by`. | `gate` builder. |
| `workflow/checkpoint` | Stable checkpoint id (the step's own local id). | `checkpoint` builder. |
| `workflow/checkpoint-kind` | Decision owner: `"human"` or `"agent"` (unenforced, provenance only — TEN-002). | `checkpoint` builder, from `:kind`. |
| `workflow/choices` | Vector of allowed choice-name strings. | `checkpoint` builder, from `:choices`. |
| `workflow/choice-details` | Map of choice name → `{"label" .. "description" .. "next" .. "input" [{"key" .. "required" .. "description" ..} ..]}`. `"input"` holds a choice's declared input requirement. | `checkpoint` builder, from map-form `:choices` entries. |
| `workflow/decision-point` | Freeform label naming what the checkpoint decides (devflow convention). | Caller-supplied `:attributes`, e.g. devflow. |
| `workflow/action-ref` | Semantic name of the action an agent should perform for this step (`"devflow.worktree.ensure"`, `"pr.ci.wait"`); the tool-binding key for forge-agnostic definitions (see "Tool bindings"). | Caller-supplied `:attributes`. |
| `workflow/instruction` | Freeform instruction text surfaced in `step-view`. | Caller-supplied `:attributes`. |
| `workflow/artifact` | Pointer to the artifact a step produces, surfaced in `step-view`. | Caller-supplied `:attributes`. |
| `workflow/outcome` | The choice name recorded when a checkpoint closes via a `:next`-routed or plain choice. | `choose!`, on the checkpoint step, at close. |
| `workflow/outcome-input` | The `input` map passed to `choose!`. | `choose!`, on the checkpoint step, at close. |
| `workflow/outcome-by` | Actor identity that closed the strand; `"engine"` on an auto-closed procedure join. | `choose!` (checkpoint close, when opts supply `:by`); `complete!` (gate close, where `:by` is mandatory); join auto-close (`"engine"`). |
| `workflow/outcome-notes` | Freeform notes recorded when a step closes. | `complete!`, from `opts :notes`. |
| `workflow/procedure` | Name of the `call` id whose expansion this join step represents. | `expand-call-step`, on the procedure join step. |
| `workflow/bond` | `"sequential"` — recorded on the bond edge itself, marking a cross-molecule bond. | `bond!`. |
| `workflow/squashed-root` | Root id of the subgraph a digest strand replaced. | `squash!`. |
| `workflow/squashed-count` | Number of strands folded into a digest. | `squash!` (one subgraph); `squash-run!` (all a run's molecules). |
| `workflow/summary` | Compact JSON-safe run summary on an `squash-run!` digest: a vector of `{"title" .. "outcomes" [..]}` maps, one per squashed molecule in creation order. | `squash-run!`. |
| `skills` | Freeform skill/tool hint for a step (not `workflow/`-namespaced; devflow convention, surfaced by `step-view`). | Caller-supplied `:attributes`. |

Other plain (non-`workflow/`-namespaced) attributes pass through from a step's `:attributes` as-is; `step-strand` itself adds only the `workflow/role`/`workflow/form` pair and lifts a step's `:description` field into a plain `"description"` attribute.

## 8. Worked examples

Worked, runnable compositions live in the companion [`workflow.cookbook.md`](./workflow.cookbook.md), each with the situation it suits, a complete snippet, and why that shape is right. Start there for:

- a linear stage with a human sign-off and a `:revise` loop (the former
  end-to-end example);
- routing a multi-stage lifecycle through named `:next` stages;
- reusing a sub-flow with `call`;
- external wait points with gates;
- forge-agnostic tool bindings;
- fan-out over a collection with a chained `:loop`.

The test suite in [`test/skein/spools/workflow_test.clj`](../test/skein/spools/workflow_test.clj) drives every documented behavior against a real weaver and doubles as an executable reference.
