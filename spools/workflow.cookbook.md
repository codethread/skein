# Skein Workflow Spool — Cookbook

Composition recipes for `skein.spools.workflow`: how to shape real workflows out
of the primitives, and *why* each shape is the right one.

This is the **how/why** half of the workflow docs. The other two halves are:

- [`workflow.md`](./workflow.md) — the **contract**: guarantees, run
  lifecycle, routing semantics, and the `workflow/*` attribute vocabulary. Read
  it for what the engine promises.
- [`workflow.api.md`](./workflow.api.md) — the **generated reference**: every
  public fn's signature, arities, and docstring, produced from the source.

Division of truth: signatures and argument lists live in the generated API doc;
narrative and composition live here and in the contract. This cookbook never
restates a fn signature or the attribute table — it links to them. When a recipe
needs an exact arity, follow the link.

## How to read a recipe

Every recipe has the same four parts, so you can skim to the one that matches
your situation and lift the snippet:

1. **Situation** — the shape of problem you're staring at.
2. **Composition** — which primitives combine, and how.
3. **Snippet** — a complete, runnable form (assume
   `(require '[skein.spools.workflow :as workflow])`).
4. **Why this shape** — the reasoning: why these primitives, what the attribute
   conventions buy you, and what the alternative would cost.

Each recipe cites the honest source it was distilled from — a shipped spool, the
repo's own config, or the test suite — so you can read the load-bearing version.

## Recipe: A linear stage with human sign-off and a revise loop

**Situation.** You have a short run of work that a human approves at the end —
and when they don't approve, the stage should re-run without repeating the
one-time orientation it opened with.

**Composition.** Ordinary `step`s chained by `:depends-on`, terminated by a
`checkpoint` whose choices are an approve (dead-ends the run) and a `:revise`
(re-pours this same definition). A `:condition [:!= :revision true]` marks the
steps that must not repeat on a revise round.

```clojure
(require '[skein.spools.workflow :as workflow])

(defn ship-workflow [{:keys [revision] :as _params}]
  (workflow/workflow
    (fn [{:keys [feature]}] (str "Ship " feature))
    {:params {:feature (workflow/param :required true)
              :revision (workflow/param :default (boolean revision))}}
    (workflow/step :design
                   (fn [{:keys [feature]}] (str "Design " feature))
                   :self
                   :condition [:!= :revision true])       ; skip on revise rounds
    (workflow/step :implement
                   (fn [{:keys [feature]}] (str "Implement " feature))
                   :self
                   :depends-on [:design])
    (workflow/checkpoint :signoff
                         "Approve implementation?"
                         :depends-on [:implement]
                         :kind :human
                         :choices [{:key :approved
                                    :label "Approve"
                                    :description "Ship it."}
                                   {:key :revise
                                    :label "Revise"
                                    :description "Send implementation back and re-run the stage."
                                    :revise {:params {:revision true}}}])))

;; run — seed :definition so :revise can re-pour ship-workflow, and :context so
;; the revise loop carries :feature forward. Every mutation returns
;; {:ready [...] :done bool}; each ready view also carries :run-id "ship-feature-x".
(workflow/start! "ship-feature-x" (ship-workflow {:feature "feature x"})
                 {:feature "feature x"}
                 {:definition 'my.ns/ship-workflow :context {:feature "feature x"}})
;; => {:ready [{:id :design ...}] :done false}

(workflow/complete! "ship-feature-x")
;; => {:ready [{:id :implement ...}] :done false}

(workflow/complete! "ship-feature-x")
;; => {:ready [{:id :signoff :kind "checkpoint" :choices ["approved" "revise"] ...}] :done false}

;; revise: closes this round's root and pours a fresh one under the same
;; run-id; :design is condition-skipped, so the round is ready at :implement
(workflow/choose! "ship-feature-x" :revise {})
;; => {:ready [{:id :implement ...}] :done false}

;; advance! also drives the run one step regardless of kind
(workflow/advance! "ship-feature-x")
;; => {:ready [{:id :signoff ...}] :done false}

;; approve: closes the checkpoint; no :next means the run is now done
(workflow/choose! "ship-feature-x" :approved {})
;; => {:ready [] :done true}   ; all step/checkpoint/procedure strands closed

(workflow/done? "ship-feature-x")
;; => true
```

**Why this shape.**

- **`:revise` over a hand-written wrapper.** A `:revise {:params {...}}` choice
  re-pours the run's *own* `workflow/definition` under the same `run-id`, so you
  never write a "revision" variant of the workflow. That is also why `start!`
  seeds `:definition` — `:revise` fails loudly without a resolvable definition on
  the root (contract [§5, "`:revise`"](./workflow.md#5-checkpoints-and-routing)).
- **`:condition` + splicing, not a manual branch.** `:condition [:!= :revision
  true]` drops `:design` from the compiled graph on a revise round; condition
  splicing reattaches `:implement` (which depended on `:design`) to the round's
  entry, so the loop is ready exactly at the first genuinely-repeatable step. No
  edge rewiring by hand.
- **Each round is a fresh immutable subgraph.** There is no reopen; every revise
  round pours a new molecule under the same `run-id`, so the whole loop history
  stays in the graph, inspectable via `run-history` and squashable later.

Honest source: adapted from the end-to-end example that formerly lived in
`workflow.md`, and mirrored by `skein.spools.devflow`'s
`human-signoff-proposal` revise loop.

## Recipe: Routing a multi-stage lifecycle through named stages

**Situation.** Your process is several stages long — propose, then spec+plan,
then implement — and each stage ends with a decision that hands off to the *next*
stage rather than looping. You want the stages to be independently reloadable.

**Composition.** Register each stage constructor under a stable keyword with
`register-workflow!`, then route forward from a checkpoint with `:next
:that-keyword`. The registry is the indirection layer.

```clojure
(require '[skein.spools.workflow :as workflow])

;; Register every stage under a stable name once (devflow does this on load and
;; again from install!, so a reload re-points in-flight runs).
(def stage-workflows
  {:proposal  'my.ns/proposal-workflow
   :spec-plan 'my.ns/spec-plan-workflow
   :abort     'my.ns/abort-workflow})

(defn register-stages! []
  (into {} (map (fn [[name sym]] [name (workflow/register-workflow! name sym)]))
        stage-workflows))

(defn proposal-workflow [{:keys [revision] :as _opts}]
  (workflow/workflow
    (fn [{:keys [feature]}] (str "Proposal: " feature))
    {:params {:feature (workflow/param :required true)
              :revision (workflow/param :default (boolean revision))}}
    (workflow/step :write-proposal (fn [{:keys [feature]}] (str "Write proposal for " feature)) :self
                   :condition [:!= :revision true])
    (workflow/checkpoint :human-signoff
                         "Human sign-off for the proposal"
                         :depends-on [:write-proposal]
                         :kind :human
                         :choices [{:key :approved
                                    :label "Approve"
                                    :description "Proposal accepted; continue to spec and plan."
                                    :next :spec-plan}                    ; forward: registered name
                                   {:key :revise
                                    :label "Revise"
                                    :description "Proposal needs changes; re-run this stage."
                                    :revise {:params {:revision true}}}  ; loop: re-pour self
                                   {:key :abort
                                    :label "Abort"
                                    :description "Stop this feature intentionally."
                                    :next :abort
                                    :input [{:key :reason :required true
                                             :description "Why abort"}]}])))
```

**Why this shape.**

- **Registered names survive reloads; raw symbols don't.** A `:next` *keyword* is
  resolved through the registry at `choose!` time, so re-registering a stage (a
  reload) re-points every in-flight run's not-yet-chosen route at the new
  constructor. A `:next` *symbol* is part of the run's durability contract —
  rename the fn and you break the in-flight run. Prefer the keyword for anything
  that may be reloaded (contract [§5, "Named workflows"](./workflow.md#5-checkpoints-and-routing)).
- **Routing is a hard cutover, not a fork.** Choosing `:next` closes out every
  remaining step of the current stage in one transaction and pours the
  continuation under the same `run-id`. Any step not yet reached is *abandoned*,
  not paused. Design each stage so nothing important sits past the checkpoint.
- **`:input` makes a decision self-describing.** Declaring `:input [{:key :reason
  :required true ...}]` means `choose!` fails loudly before any mutation if the
  reason is missing, and a driving agent can read what the decision needs via
  `choice-details` before making it.
- **Every mutation returns the same `{:ready [...] :done bool}` shape**, so a
  routed hand-off is visible in-band: the continuation's ready frontier comes
  straight back from `choose!`.

Honest source: `skein.spools.devflow`'s `stage-workflows` registry and
`proposal-workflow` (proposal → `:spec-plan` forward route, self `:revise` loop,
`:abort` with declared reason input).

## Recipe: Reusing a sub-flow with `call`

**Situation.** The same sub-procedure — a review pass, a CI round, a quality
check — needs to run inside several different stages, and you don't want to
copy its steps into each one.

**Composition.** Define the sub-flow as an ordinary workflow constructor, then
splice it into a parent with `call`. Each `call` inlines the sub-flow's steps and
adds a `procedure`-role join that downstream steps depend on.

```clojure
(require '[skein.spools.workflow :as workflow])

(defn review-workflow [_]
  (workflow/workflow
    "Review"
    {:params {:artifact (workflow/param :required true)}}
    (workflow/step :inspect      (fn [{:keys [artifact]}] (str "Inspect " artifact)) :self)
    (workflow/step :write-review (fn [{:keys [artifact]}] (str "Write review for " artifact)) :self
                   :depends-on [:inspect])))

(def demo
  (workflow/workflow
    "Procedure demo"
    (workflow/step :write-artifact "Write artifact" :self)
    (workflow/call :review-artifact review-workflow {:artifact "proposal.md"}
                   :depends-on [:write-artifact])
    (workflow/step :continue "Continue" :self
                   :depends-on [:review-artifact])))       ; waits on the whole call
```

**Why this shape.**

- **`call` inlines; it doesn't bond.** The sub-flow's steps compile into the
  parent's own strand set (ids namespaced `review-artifact--inspect`, …), so the
  ready frontier flows naturally from parent step to sub-flow step to the next
  parent step. Depending on the `call` id (`:review-artifact`) means "wait for the
  whole procedure".
- **The join auto-closes — never complete it by hand.** When you close the last
  inner step beneath a `call`, its `procedure` join closes in the *same*
  transaction (stamped `workflow/outcome-by "engine"`). Joins never surface as
  ready work, so an agent driving the run sees the parent's next step, not a
  bookkeeping strand (contract [§4, "Procedure join auto-close"](./workflow.md#4-run-lifecycle)).
- **One definition, many call sites.** The same `review-workflow` can be
  `call`-ed by a proposal stage and a spec stage with different `:artifact`
  params; a CI-round sub-flow can be recomposed by every stage that pushes
  commits. That is the point of `call` over duplication.

Honest source: the `call` inlining test in
`test/skein/spools/workflow_test.clj` (`workflow-spool-inlines-procedure-calls`),
the toastie demo's `:quality` call, and `skein.spools.devflow`'s
`:agent-review-proposal` call.

## Recipe: External wait points with gates

**Situation.** Some steps aren't the driving agent's to *do* — they're waits: CI
must go green, a sub-agent must finish, a human must weigh in. The agent should
be told to poll or hand off, not to try the work itself.

**Composition.** Model each wait as a `gate` with a freeform waiter hint (`:ci`,
`:subagent`, `:human`). The external actor closes it via `complete!` with a
mandatory `:by`. Optionally register an executor for a waiter class so `await!`
stays quiet while an adapter is healthy.

```clojure
(require '[skein.spools.workflow :as workflow])

(defn pr-ci-round-workflow [{:keys [bindings] :as _opts}]
  (workflow/workflow
    (fn [{:keys [feature]}] (str "CI round for " feature))
    {:params {:feature (workflow/param :required true)}}
    (workflow/gate :ci-wait
                   (fn [{:keys [feature]}] (str "Wait for CI on " feature))
                   :ci)                                     ; waiter hint: not :self
    (workflow/checkpoint :ci-verdict "Judge CI result"
                         :depends-on [:ci-wait]
                         :kind :agent
                         :choices [{:key :green :label "CI green"
                                    :next 'my.ns/pr-review-round-workflow}
                                   {:key :red :label "CI red"
                                    :next 'my.ns/pr-fix-ci-workflow}])))

;; the external actor (or an adapter) closes the gate — :by is mandatory
(workflow/complete! "pr-flow" {:step ci-wait-id :by "ci-bot"})
;; the driving agent then observes the world and decides the verdict checkpoint
(workflow/choose! "pr-flow" :green)
```

**Why this shape.**

- **The runtime is pull-based; every strand is already a durable wait point.** A
  gate doesn't add a scheduling primitive — it just *labels* a step "not yours,
  wait for `<waiter>`". `step-view` surfaces it as `:gate "ci"`, so a driving
  agent treats a ready gate as **poll/hand off, don't do** (contract
  [§3, "Gates"](./workflow.md#3-definition-layer)).
- **`:by` is mandatory on a gate close** and records `workflow/outcome-by`, so
  the audit trail always names who satisfied the wait. `complete!` fails loudly
  if you try to close a gate without it.
- **Executors keep `await!` honest per waiter class.** Register an executor for
  `:subagent` and a coordinator's `await!` stays silent while that adapter is
  healthy, waking only on a genuine stall. A waiter with *no* registered
  executor always surfaces immediately — there is no silent default. The shipped
  `skein.spools.treadle` does exactly this for `:subagent` gates.
- **Checkpoints, not conditional edges, carry the branch.** The gate waits; the
  *checkpoint after it* is where the driving agent turns an observation (CI
  verdict) into a route. Parallelism falls out of edge absence; branching lives
  in checkpoint choices.

Honest source: the forge-agnostic PR flow in
`test/skein/spools/workflow_test.clj`
(`workflow-models-pull-request-flow-without-conditional-edges`) and the
`:subagent` gate that `skein.spools.treadle` fulfills.

## Recipe: Forge-agnostic tool bindings

**Situation.** A workflow touches an external tool — a git forge, CI, a deploy
target — but you want the *same* definition to run against GitHub for one user
and GitLab for another, with no edit to the workflow.

**Composition.** Steps name only a semantic `workflow/action-ref`
(`"pr.ci.wait"`). The concrete command arrives through a **bindings map**
(action-ref → attribute map) passed as pure data. Ship one forge's bindings as
the default; a user deep-merges an override from trusted config.

```clojure
(require '[skein.spools.workflow :as workflow])

;; Reference bindings shipped as the default; a user rebinds any subset.
(def github-pr-bindings
  {:pr.ci.wait {:instruction "gh pr checks --watch --fail-fast" :skills "ci-watch"}
   :pr.merge   {:instruction "gh pr merge --squash"}})

(def binding-attr-keys {:instruction "workflow/instruction" :skills "skills"})

(defn bind-attrs
  "Merge one action's binding into canonical step attributes, failing loudly on
  an unbound action or a key outside the binding vocabulary."
  [bindings action-ref]
  (let [bindings (or bindings github-pr-bindings)
        bound (or (get bindings action-ref)
                  (throw (ex-info "No binding for workflow action"
                                  {:action-ref action-ref :bound (vec (keys bindings))})))]
    (when-let [unknown (seq (remove binding-attr-keys (keys bound)))]
      (throw (ex-info "Unknown binding keys"
                      {:action-ref action-ref :unknown (vec unknown)})))
    (merge {"workflow/action-ref" (name action-ref)}
           (into {} (map (fn [[k v]] [(binding-attr-keys k) v])) bound))))

(defn ci-round [{:keys [bindings] :as _opts}]
  (workflow/workflow
    (fn [{:keys [feature]}] (str "CI round for " feature))
    {:params {:feature (workflow/param :required true)}}
    (workflow/gate :ci-wait (fn [{:keys [feature]}] (str "Wait for CI on " feature)) :ci
                   :attributes (bind-attrs bindings :pr.ci.wait))))

;; A GitLab user overrides only the fields that differ, deep-merging over the
;; reference — no change to ci-round:
(def gitlab-overrides
  (merge-with merge github-pr-bindings
              {:pr.ci.wait {:instruction "glab ci status --live"}}))
```

**Why this shape.**

- **The engine never executes**, so a definition that names a tool would bake in
  a forge. Keeping steps at `action-ref` and pushing commands into a data
  bindings map means the definition is forge-agnostic and the *binding* is the
  only thing that varies.
- **Deep-merge gives per-field granularity.** `(merge-with merge reference
  overrides)` lets a user rebind one action's `:instruction` while inheriting the
  rest — the definition never changes and the user touches only what differs.
- **The binding vocabulary is the author's, and it fails loudly.** `bind-attrs`
  rejects an unbound action and any key outside `binding-attr-keys`, so a typo in
  user bindings surfaces immediately instead of yielding a silently bare step.
- **Bindings round-trip across routed rounds.** They ride `workflow/context`;
  keeping binding keys simple keywords (`:pr.ci.wait`, `:instruction`) and
  mapping them onto the canonical string attribute vocabulary
  (`"workflow/instruction"`) at build time keeps them faithful across the JSON
  layer (contract [§3, "Tool bindings"](./workflow.md#3-definition-layer)).

Honest source: the `github-pr-bindings` / `bind-attrs` reference in
`test/skein/spools/workflow_test.clj`
(`workflow-pr-flow-rebinds-forge-without-spool-changes`), GitHub shipped as
default, GitLab swapped in as a partial override.

## Recipe: Fan-out over a collection with a chained loop

**Situation.** You have N items — delegated tasks, target hosts, files — and want
one step per item, run in sequence, with per-item instructions computed from the
item. A downstream step should wait for the whole batch.

**Composition.** One `step` or `gate` with `:loop {:each :items :chain true}`.
Fn-valued `:attributes` render per iteration against the item; `:chain true`
serializes the expansions; a later step depending on the *base* loop id fans in
over all expansions.

```clojure
(require '[skein.spools.workflow :as workflow])

(defn delegate-pipeline [{:keys [run-id tasks harness cwd]}]
  (workflow/workflow
    (str "Delegated pipeline: " run-id)
    {:params {:run-id  (workflow/param :default run-id)
              :tasks   (workflow/param :default tasks)
              :harness (workflow/param :default harness)
              :cwd     (workflow/param :default cwd)}
     :attributes {"workflow/family" "delegate-pipeline"}}
    ;; one :subagent gate per task, chained so task i waits on task i-1
    (workflow/gate :task
                   (fn [{:keys [item]}] (str "Delegate pipeline task " (:id item)))
                   :subagent
                   :loop {:each :tasks :chain true}
                   :attributes {"shuttle/harness" (fn [{:keys [item harness]}]
                                                    (or (:harness item) harness))
                                "shuttle/prompt"  (fn [{:keys [item]}] (:body item))
                                "shuttle/cwd"     (fn [{:keys [item cwd]}]
                                                    (or (:cwd item) cwd))})
    ;; depends on the *base* loop id :task -> fans in over every expansion
    (workflow/checkpoint :accept "Accept delegated pipeline"
                         :depends-on [:task]
                         :kind :human
                         :choices [{:key :accepted :label "Accept"
                                    :description "Delegated pipeline output is accepted."}])))
```

**Why this shape.**

- **`:loop` expands after params resolve**, so each copy's fn-valued
  `title`/`attributes` render against `(merge params {:item item :i idx})` — the
  per-task `:harness`/`:cwd`/`:body` fall out of the item, with a workflow-level
  default when the item omits them (contract [§3, "Loops"](./workflow.md#3-definition-layer)).
- **`:chain true` serializes; edge absence would parallelize.** Chaining makes
  task *i* depend on task *i-1*, which is what a *pipeline* needs. Drop `:chain`
  and every expansion is independently ready — a fan-out, not a sequence.
- **Base-id fan-in keeps the downstream rule simple.** The `:accept` checkpoint
  depends on the base id `:task`, and the engine rewrites that to depend on *all*
  expanded task ids — so "wait for the whole batch" is one edge, even when the
  loop is chained.
- **Gate + attributes hand off cleanly to an adapter.** Because each expansion is
  a `:subagent` gate carrying `shuttle/*` attributes, `skein.spools.treadle` can
  fulfill it by spawning a shuttle run and closing the gate with the result — the
  workflow definition never names the shuttle.

Honest source: the `delegate-pipeline` weave pattern in this repo's
[`.skein/config.clj`](../.skein/config.clj) (chained `:subagent` gate loop with
fn-valued `shuttle/*` attributes and a base-id fan-in to the accept checkpoint).

- `(skein.spools.workflow/explain)` — machine-readable builder contracts, meant
  to be called before constructing workflow data.
