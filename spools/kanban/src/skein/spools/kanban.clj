  "User-facing kanban board over Skein strands.

  Cards are the user<->agent tracking surface: everything a user asks for is a
  `feature` card (occasionally grouped under an `epic`), and every agent
  working directly with a user works under a claimed card. All card state
  lives under `kanban/*` attributes; `kanban/status` is the board lane
  (`refinement` -> `pending` -> `claimed` -> `in_review` -> explicit closed outcome) and
  `kanban/priority` (p1 immediate blocker .. p4 someday, default p3) orders
  lanes and `kanban next`.

  Cards are work roots: claiming stamps `owner`/`branch`/`worktree`, and
  plans, devflow runs, and task DAGs hang beneath the card with `parent-of`
  edges — the kanban spool complements those workflows, it does not replace
  them. Notes are closed child note strands, so a cold agent can
  self-discover in-flight work: `kanban board` -> `kanban card <id>` ->
  the doing-task and its latest note."
