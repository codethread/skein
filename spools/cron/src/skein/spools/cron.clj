  "Userland recurrence layer over the weaver's durable scheduler wake primitive.

  Cron registers named jobs that fire on a fixed interval with uniform jitter.
  It owns no timing of its own: each registered job is a durable `cron/<id>`
  scheduler wake (`skein.api.scheduler.alpha`), so the cadence survives weaver
  restart and reload, and scheduler introspection is the single timing view. A
  caller registers a job by fully-qualified `:handler` symbol resolving to a
  `(fn [runtime] ..)`; the engine owns only the wake wiring, the job's
  last-result status, and a loud inspectable failure log. It is deliberately
  just recurrence — workflow/gate integration is intentionally out of scope.

  Delivery model. The scheduler dispatches a due `cron/<id>` wake to
  `fire-wake` on the weaver's shared serialized event lane. `fire-wake` stays
  tiny so it never holds the lane on job work: it reschedules the next wake and
  hands the job body off to a cron-owned execution executor, then returns so the
  scheduler completes the delivered wake. The job's own success/failure is
  recorded cron-side and never interrupts cadence. Delivery is at-least-once, so
  `:handler` bodies must tolerate duplicate fires (TEN-003, `SPEC-004.C101`).

  State is runtime-owned via `skein.api.runtime.alpha/spool-state`, so two
  runtimes in one JVM keep independent executors, job tables, and failure logs.
  The in-memory job table carries no cadence: it is repopulated by trusted
  config re-running `register!` after each startup/reload, while the durable
  wake in SQLite is the sole authority for when a job next fires."

  `job` keys:
