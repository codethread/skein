  "Alpha workflow spool for molecule and wisp-style strand graphs.

  A workflow definition is plain data. `compile` turns that data into a Skein
  batch payload, while `pour!` and `wisp!` materialize persistent molecules and
  ephemeral wisps through the public batch alpha surface. Workflow and executor
  registries are runtime-owned spool state; graph operations compose existing
  strand primitives.

  This is the public story file. The DSL builders and every run-driving op live
  here; the mechanics they compose live in `skein.spools.workflow.internal.*`:
  `compile` (compile/normalize/expand pipeline), `query` (run views/ready/done/
  history), `routing` (checkpoint choice validation, routing, and cascading
  closes), `registry` (runtime-owned registries), and `util` (shared validation/
  ref-normalization). Specs stay registered here so `explain` and
  `s/explain-data` paths are unchanged."
