  "Fulfil workflow `:shell` gates by running their command off the event thread.

  The shell executor watches workflow runs for ready gates whose waiter is
  `:shell`, runs the gate's `shell/argv` directly (no implicit shell) on a
  spool-owned worker pool, and closes the gate through
  `skein.spools.workflow/complete!` on a zero exit. A non-zero exit, timeout,
  spawn error, or invalid argv stamps a loud, distinct `gate/error` and leaves
  the gate ready and stamped rather than masquerading as a completed run. It is
  a subagent-executor sibling minus everything agent-run-specific: the failure
  detail lives on the gate itself, so there is no separate run strand, no
  `delegates` edge, and no session/harness vocabulary. This namespace is the
  only adapter that knows both the workflow gate contract and process
  execution."
