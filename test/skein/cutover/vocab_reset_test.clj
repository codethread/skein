(ns skein.cutover.vocab-reset-test
  "Focused coverage for the vocabulary-reset cutover against a disposable weaver
  world, so the rewrite is proved on the real schema rather than a hand-rolled
  fixture: the world is seeded through the weaver, migrated through the script's
  own datasource (the way an operator runs it), and read back through the weaver.

  The cases are the ones the table cannot make obvious by inspection — the
  guarded splits (a bare key that is only agent-run's word on a task strand, an
  overloaded bench/run that stays put on marker rows, a kanban/status that is a
  lane only where it holds one), the guarded drops (a roster/* key goes only
  where the bare twin it is redundant with survives it, a kanban/devflow alias
  only where the canonical binding answers), the two readings a decline can
  carry and the exit code that separates them, the registry's boundary, the
  closed-strand scope boundary, idempotency, and the loud refusals."
