  "End-to-end proofs for the two load-bearing properties of the wake-backed cron
  spool (`PLAN-cron-on-scheduler-001.PH2`), driven against real weaver runtimes
  in disposable worlds the way trusted config would drive them.

  `.V1` restart durability: a cron job's cadence lives in its durable `cron/<id>`
  scheduler wake, so it survives a real weaver stop/start — a fresh weaver adopts
  the pending wake through the startup-config path (re-running the identical
  `register!` with no in-memory config preserves the countdown, `.A4`) and the
  job fires and re-arms. Unlike `scheduler_e2e_test`'s restart proof, cron's
  `fire-wake` needs the in-memory job present before it fires, so the adopted
  wake is released deterministically off a manual clock after `register!` rather
  than by the wall-clock startup timer; the seed instant is therefore placed in
  the wall future so the startup timer stays dormant until `advance!` drives it.

  `.V2` lane hygiene: a blocking `:handler` never holds the shared event lane —
  `fire-wake` offloads the body to the cron executor, so `await-quiescent!`
  returns while the job is still blocked and a subsequent event still dispatches.

  Fires drive off a manual runtime clock and `skein.test.alpha/advance!`; job
  results join via `cron/await-quiescent!` — no `Thread/sleep` or wall waits
  (`.V3`). Handlers are resolved by fully qualified symbol, so their fire and
  latch signals live in namespace state the tests reset between runs."
