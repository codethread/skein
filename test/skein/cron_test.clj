  "Tests for the skein.spools.cron recurrence engine against a real weaver
  runtime: jobs register as durable `cron/<id>` scheduler wakes, a due wake
  fires on the shared event lane, offloads its `:handler` to the execution
  executor, reschedules the next wake, and records results without stopping the
  cadence.

  Fires drive off a manual runtime clock and `skein.test.alpha/advance!`: the
  scheduler's own clock pump releases the due wake onto the event lane, so
  `advance!` + `test-alpha/await-quiescent!` settles the lane and
  `cron/await-quiescent!` joins the offloaded job body — no `Thread/sleep` or
  wall waits
  (`PLAN-cron-on-scheduler-001.V3`). Cron registers no pump of its own."
