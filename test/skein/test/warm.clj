  "Per-worktree warm test REPL bootstrap for the `:test-repl` alias.

  `-main` starts a `clojure.core.server` socket REPL on an ephemeral port,
  records the chosen port and this process's PID in `.test-repl-port` and
  `.test-repl.pid` at the worktree root (both gitignored) so a shell helper can
  connect to the socket and later reap the process by recorded PID, and arms a
  daemon idle watchdog: each client connection refreshes the deadline, and
  after `idle-limit-minutes` with no connection the server deletes both runtime
  files and exits. This is dev/test tooling on the test classpath, off the
  blessed `skein.test.alpha` vocabulary; the agent-facing focused-run entry is
  `skein.test.alpha/run-focused!`."
