;; Pull-request flow modelled without conditional edges: every branch is a
;; checkpoint choice the driving agent makes after observing the world (CI
;; verdict, review outcome), and every external wait is a gate. The CI round
;; is one reusable workflow recomposed via `call` by each stage that pushes
;; commits, and its verdict checkpoint always routes green to review and red
;; to the fix loop.
;;
;; The definitions are forge-agnostic: steps carry only semantic
;; workflow/action-ref names, and the concrete forge commands arrive as a
;; pure-data bindings map (action-ref -> attribute map) through params — pure
;; data so bindings survive workflow/context round-trips across routed loop
;; rounds. github ships as the reference; a user rebinds any subset from the
;; outside without touching a definition (see PLAN.md).

;; binding keys ride workflow/context across routed loop rounds: map keys come
;; back keywordized and are written with their full ns/name form
;; (skein.core.db/json-key), so keyword keys round-trip faithfully. Simple keyword
;; keys stay the convention here; bind-attrs maps them onto the canonical
;; string attribute vocabulary.
