  "End-to-end hardening for the weaver scheduler (PH4).

  The storage layer (`skein.core.scheduler-test`), the runtime timer/dispatch
  module (`skein.scheduler-runtime-test`), and the blessed API tier
  (`skein.api.scheduler.alpha-test`) each cover their own seam. This namespace
  exercises the whole primitive against real weaver runtimes in disposable
  worlds the way a userland caller would: schedule through the blessed API, let
  a due handler mutate the strand graph on the shared async lane, and read the
  result back through data-first introspection; then prove a wake scheduled by
  one weaver survives a real stop/start and re-arms in a fresh weaver."
