  "Seam contract coverage for the lifecycle-hooks API.

  The broad behavior lock — hook invocation ordering through the lifecycle
  gates, reload interplay — stays in `skein.weaver-test` and `skein.alpha-test`.
  This namespace pins the loud registration seam, unregistration idempotence,
  the data-first read shape, and that the hook registry is owner-partition
  backed so owner removal, same-layer collision, and authorized override behave
  end to end (TASK-Olr-002.DW2)."
