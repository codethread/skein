  "API-tier coverage for the blessed scheduler namespace (PH3).

  Storage validation lives in `skein.core.scheduler-test` and runtime timer/
  dispatch behavior lives in `skein.scheduler-runtime-test`; here the focus is
  `skein.api.scheduler.alpha` itself: explicit-runtime schedule!/cancel!,
  pending-wake shapes (decoded payload, symbol handler), the classloader
  handler-resolution check this tier adds on top of storage validation, and
  that a rejected schedule! persists nothing."
