  "External-style coverage for the blessed owner-registry primitive.

  Exercises the API the way a spool domain would: declare a kind, publish and
  delete complete owner partitions, read immutable snapshots, and explain the
  shadow/override state — without reaching into the storage kernel. Two
  independent registries live in two unpublished runtimes to prove owner
  partitions and versioned spool-state handles never cross-talk."
