(ns skein.large-attr-benchmark-test
  "Structural smoke for the large-attr load harness.

  Boots the disposable `:publish? false` world and paired fixtures at tiny `N`,
  runs one iteration of every scenario against the real shipped read paths, and
  asserts each is wired and returns a well-formed sample. Deliberately carries no
  wall-clock assertion (`PLAN-LargeAttrScaling-001.A5`/`TC4`): every timing number
  is informational and lives in the report, never in a gate, so this test cannot
  flake under concurrent suites."
