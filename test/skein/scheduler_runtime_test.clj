  "Runtime lifecycle and clock-dispatch coverage for the weaver scheduler (PH2).

  Storage-layer behavior lives in `skein.core.scheduler-test`; here the focus is
  the runtime module `skein.core.weaver.scheduler`: due-row dispatch under a
  deterministic injected clock, at-least-once handling of a saturated event
  lane, handler resolution/invocation/failure capture through `run-fire!`, and
  the end-to-end startup/reload re-arm + close-on-stop thread hygiene against a
  real weaver runtime and its shared event worker."
