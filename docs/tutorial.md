# Skein tutorial

This tutorial takes you from nothing to a working Skein setup, then a little further, into the live REPL and a taste of customisation. You can follow it top to bottom. You do not need to know Clojure or any graph tooling to start.

It is written in two halves:

1. **The everyday CLI** — install, start a weaver, add strands, ask what is
   ready. This is all most people need day to day.
2. **The live machine** — the REPL, named queries, and where customisation
   starts. Optional, and clearly marked, so you can stop after part one and
   come back later.

The guide marks places where you can skip ahead. If a section is not what you need right now, skip it. Already sold on the live-runtime story and want to jump straight to it? Go to [The REPL: a live machine](#the-repl-a-live-machine).

## Prefer to learn by asking?

Skein's own repository is written to be read by coding agents, and it ships agent-facing docs, `prime` orientation commands, and the specs behind every contract. If you already work with a coding agent, you can point it at a Skein checkout and ask questions as you go.

- `mill skein prime` prints orientation for the Skein source, docs, and how to
  extend a `.skein` config. `mill strand prime` explains the strand
  planning-and-tracking workflow. Both run with no weaver.
- `docs/reference.md`, the `spools/` contracts, and `devflow/specs/` hold the real
  detail.

An agent that has read that surface can answer "how do I model a review step?" or "what belongs in the CLI versus the REPL?" interactively. You can follow this guide without an agent; the agent is optional.

## The mental model in one minute

A **strand** is a small record with three parts: a title, a **lifecycle `state`** (whether it is `active`, `closed`, or `replaced`), and an **open map of `attributes`**. "Open map" means the attribute names are yours to invent (`owner`, `priority`, `kind`, `kanban`, whatever your workflow needs) instead of waiting for a schema to grow.

Strands connect with **edges**: links from one strand to another. Edges are **typed**, meaning each carries a relation name like `depends-on`, and they can carry attributes of their own.

You work with strands two ways:

- The **`strand` CLI** for everyday create, update, and read. Its commands print
  JSON, so scripts and agents can consume them.
- The **weaver's REPL** for everything richer: querying, mutating, and extending
  Skein while it runs, without restarting anything. A REPL is an interactive
  Clojure prompt; more on it in part two.

The CLI stays deliberately thin. Runtime customization lives in trusted config and the REPL. See [PHILOSOPHY.md](../devflow/PHILOSOPHY.md) for why the line is drawn there.

## Before you start

You need a few things on the machine:

- **Git**, and a Git repository to track work in. Skein is repo-first and does
  not run outside Git.
- **make**, to build and install the CLIs.
- **Go**, which compiles the `strand` and `mill` command-line tools.
- **A JVM**, which runs the weaver (Skein is a Clojure program).

Install those the usual way for your platform before the steps below.

## Install

Skein installs from a cloned source checkout of this repository.

```sh
make install
```

This builds and installs the `strand` and `mill` CLIs and records this checkout as mill's source for launching weavers. It does not change anything `mill init` writes into a repo.

## Choosing a workspace

A workspace is one isolated Skein setup. By default `strand` is **repo-first**: when you do not pass `--workspace`, `mill` looks upward for the Git repository root (the "canonical" root that linked worktrees share) and uses that repo's `.skein` directory as your workspace. Two worktrees of the same repository talk to the same weaver and the same data.

If you omit `--workspace` outside a Git repository, the command fails with a remediation message instead of guessing. It will not invent a workspace from your current directory or fall back to a global one.

That `.skein` directory holds trusted config only. The runtime state (metadata, sockets, and the SQLite database) lives under Skein's own state directory, not in your repo.

Create a workspace in the repo you want to use Skein in:

```sh
mill init
```

`mill init` creates or completes `.skein` at the Git root. It writes shared, committable config files (covered later) and never overwrites ones you already have. It fails loudly outside Git, does not run `git init`, and does not create the database; the weaver prepares storage when it starts.

**Escape hatch — throwaway workspaces.** For experiments, tests, or agent work, use a disposable workspace so you never touch a real repo's config:

```sh
workspace=$(mktemp -d)
mill init --workspace "$workspace"
```

`--workspace` is not sticky, so pass the same path on **every** command that should target it, for example `mill weaver start --workspace "$workspace"`. The plain examples below leave the flag off for readability; the customization examples later use an explicit `$workspace` so you never casually reload a real repo's config.

## Start the weaver

Start mill once in a terminal you can leave open, then ask it to start the weaver for your workspace:

```sh
mill start
mill weaver start
```

There is no separate database-init step. Starting the weaver prepares storage.

## Add and inspect strands

Add a couple of strands, with a few attributes of your own choosing:

```sh
strand add "Review docs" --attr owner=ct --attr area=docs
strand add "Scratch idea" --attr temporary=true
```

Attributes are plain `key=value` strings. `--attr temporary=true` stores the string `"true"`, not a JSON boolean; richer values are a REPL job, covered later.

List everything, or just what is ready. These commands print JSON:

```sh
strand list
strand ready
```

## Dependencies and readiness

An edge named `depends-on` from `A` to `B` means "A is blocked while B is active". To add one, you need the id of the strand you depend on. `strand add` prints the new strand as JSON, so create the blocker first and read its `"id"` from the output:

```sh
strand add "Sketch the model"
```

The output includes a field like `"id": "ab12c"`. Use that generated id (yours will differ) to add a second strand that depends on it:

```sh
strand add "Build the weaver" --edge depends-on:ab12c
strand ready
```

`ready` returns active strands whose `depends-on` targets are inactive or absent (closed, replaced, or never created), so it shows "Sketch the model" but not "Build the weaver". Close the first and the second becomes ready. Use the id printed for "Sketch the model" earlier:

```sh
strand update ab12c --state closed
strand ready
```

**Scripting tip.** Once you are comfortable, you can capture an id in one line instead of copying it by hand. `jq` is the standard JSON command-line tool, and `$(...)` runs a command and keeps its output in a shell variable:

```sh
design=$(strand add "Sketch the model" | jq -r '.id')
strand add "Build the weaver" --edge depends-on:"$design"
```

`depends-on`, `parent-of`, and `supersedes` are Skein's three **declared acyclic relations**: a "relation" is an edge type, and "acyclic" means Skein rejects cycles in each of them (A cannot end up depending on itself through a chain). It also rejects an edge from a strand to itself on any relation.

## Closing and deleting

There is no special "done" command. Close a strand when it is no longer active, and record an outcome as an attribute if you want one:

```sh
strand update <strand-id> --state closed --attr outcome=done
```

On `update`, `--attr` merges into the strand's existing attributes: this call adds `outcome=done` and leaves `owner`, `area`, and anything else already there untouched. To change one attribute, name just that one.

Closed strands stay visible with `state="closed"`. Deletion is separate and explicit:

```sh
strand burn <strand-id>
```

---

That is the everyday CLI: add, relate, ask what is ready, close, and occasionally burn. If you do not need the REPL or runtime customization, you can stop here and run `mill weaver stop`. The rest of this guide covers the REPL and building your own behavior.

## The REPL: a live machine

The weaver is a running Clojure image. `mill weaver repl` attaches directly to it, so the code you type runs inside the weaver, against your real strands, with no restart between edits.

```sh
mill weaver repl
```

For editor-driven work, see the [IDE REPL setup guide](./ide-repl/) for connecting VS Code or Calva to the running weaver's nREPL.

**Reading the Clojure below.** A handful of rules cover everything in this section:

- A call puts the function name first, inside the parentheses: `(strand! "x")`
  calls `strand!` with `"x"`.
- The `!` on a name is a convention for "this changes something", not syntax.
- A word starting with a colon, like `:owner`, is a **keyword**: a plain,
  self-describing name often used as a map key.
- Curly braces make a **map** of key/value pairs: `{:owner "ct"}`.
- `def` gives a value a name you can reuse: `(def s ...)` binds `s`.

The [Clojure crash course](./clojure-crash-course.md) covers the rest. If you came for the payoff — your own custom CLI command in trusted Clojure — the worked example lives in [customising your workspace](./spools/customisation.md).

Create a strand and look it up:

```clojure
(def s (:id (strand! "My first REPL strand" {:owner "ct"}))) ; create; keep its :id in s
(strand s)                                                   ; look it up by id
```

Create several related strands in one transactional call. `:ref` values are temporary handles (stand-in names) so `:edges` can link siblings before the real ids exist; the returned `:refs` map binds each handle to its generated id:

```clojure
(require '[skein.api.current.alpha :as current]
         '[skein.api.batch.alpha :as batch])   ; transactional graph mutations

(def refs
  (:refs
   (batch/apply! (current/runtime)
    {:strands [{:ref :design :title "Sketch the data model" :attributes {:owner "ct" :priority "high"}}
               {:ref :build  :title "Implement the weaver"  :attributes {:owner "ct"}}
               {:ref :docs   :title "Write getting-started" :attributes {:owner "agent"}}]
     :edges   [{:op :upsert :from :build :to :design :type "depends-on"}
               {:op :upsert :from :docs  :to :build  :type "depends-on"}]})))
```

Now write a small helper and use it:

```clojure
(defn brief
  "Keep just the :id and :title of each strand row."
  [rows]
  (map #(select-keys % [:id :title]) rows))

(brief (strands))   ; every strand, summarized
```

Because the weaver is live, you can improve `brief` while it runs. Redefine it, and the next call uses the new version. No restart, no lost strands:

```clojure
(require '[clojure.pprint :refer [pprint]])

(defn brief
  "Pretty-print just the :id and :title of each strand row."
  [rows]
  (pprint (map #(select-keys % [:id :title]) rows)))

(brief (strands))   ; same call, now pretty-printed
(brief (ready))     ; only strands with no active dependency
(update! s {:state "closed"})   ; close one; the row stays, state becomes "closed"
```

Skein ships graph helpers too. `graph/subgraph` walks a declared acyclic relation from a root id and returns the connected strands and edges. Fold that into an ASCII tree:

```clojure
(require '[skein.api.current.alpha :as current]
         '[skein.api.graph.alpha :as graph]
         '[clojure.string :as str])

(defn dag-tree
  "Render the depends-on subgraph under root-id as an ASCII tree of titles."
  [root-id]
  (let [{:keys [strands edges]} (graph/subgraph (current/runtime) [root-id] {:type "depends-on"})
        title    (into {} (map (juxt :id :title)) strands)
        children (group-by :from_strand_id edges)
        lines    (fn lines [id depth]
                   (cons (str (apply str (repeat (max 0 (dec depth)) "   "))
                              (when (pos? depth) "└─ ")
                              (title id))
                         (mapcat #(lines (:to_strand_id %) (inc depth))
                                 (children id))))]
    (str/join "\n" (lines root-id 0))))

(println (dag-tree (:docs refs)))   ; walk from the docs strand
```

Produces:

```text
Write getting-started
└─ Implement the weaver
   └─ Sketch the data model
```

## Named queries: from the REPL to the CLI

A query is a data expression, here "the `owner` attribute equals `ct`". Register one by name in the REPL:

```clojure
(defquery! 'mine '[:= [:attr :owner] "ct"])   ; register a query named "mine"
(strands 'mine)                               ; run it in the REPL
```

The plain CLI can discover and run the same query for as long as this weaver keeps running:

```sh
strand query list
strand query explain mine
strand list --query mine
strand ready --query mine
```

`query list` and `query explain <name>` are read-only discovery. Applying a query stays on `list --query` and `ready --query`. See the [REPL API spec](../devflow/specs/repl-api.md) for the full predicate language.

Named queries registered this way last only for the current weaver run. To keep one across restarts, register it from startup config, covered next.

## Startup config: making it stick

Weaver-lifetime state means the query above disappears at the next restart. To keep it, the workspace loads trusted startup code — `init.clj`, then a gitignored `init.local.clj` — every time the weaver starts, and a registration moved there survives every restart:

```clojure
(require '[skein.api.graph.alpha :as graph])

(graph/register-query! runtime 'mine [:= [:attr :owner] "ct"])
```

That two-line increment to the generated `init.clj` is the first rung of a ladder that runs from direct registrations, through local spools, to custom CLI commands of your own. The whole ladder — startup files, reloading a live weaver, promoting config to a spool, and worked examples — is [customising your workspace](./spools/customisation.md); this tutorial stops at showing you the rung exists.

## Stop the weaver

Stop the weaver when you are finished:

```sh
mill weaver stop --workspace "$workspace"
```

For a repo workspace, drop the flag:

```sh
mill weaver stop
```
