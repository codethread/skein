# Strand workflow

Use the `strand` CLI to plan and track multi-step work as a small explicit DAG of strands.
If `strand` fails because it cannot reach a weaver, run `mill weaver start`.

## When to use strands

- Skip strands for one small direct action.
- Create a strand plan for multi-step work, dependencies, validation, review, or
  when the user explicitly asks to use/manage strands.
- Keep plans small: usually 2-6 strands. Do not create a strand for every tiny
  sub-step.

## Discover the surface, don't assume it

Each workspace assembles its own `strand` command surface from config and spools, so the ops
available here may not match any other repo. Three tiers answer every "how do I find out?"
question:

```sh
strand help              # every registered op; strand help <op> for exact invocation
strand about <op>        # an op's manual: semantics, conventions, attribute contracts
strand prime <op>        # an area's working discipline, when the op ships one
```

Start from `strand help`. When an op's meaning goes beyond its flags (a board, a delegation
surface, a lifecycle), read its `about`; before working inside such an area, read its `prime`.
Repo conventions name the ops and queries to lead with, and they win over anything generic
here.

Fresh workspaces activate the batteries spool, so `add`, `update`, `list`, `ready`, and `show`
are normally present — verify with `strand help` rather than assuming.

## Body attribute convention

Use `body` for useful issue-style context: problem, scope, acceptance criteria, constraints,
relevant files, and validation expectations.

- Titles alone are acceptable for personal or short-lived to-do tracking.
- Any strand another agent may pick up needs a clear descriptive `body`.
- For multi-line bodies, attach the text as a payload and reference it:
  `strand --payload body=<path> add "<title>" --attr body=:payload/body` (from a
  file) or `printf '%s' "<text>" | strand --stdin add "<title>" --attr body=:stdin`.

## Standard loop

1. Check the surface first. If `strand help` lists a `pattern` op, prefer a registered weave
   pattern over hand-authored graphs: `strand pattern list`, then
   `strand pattern explain <name>` for the live contract.
2. Create or update the plan graph with the best-fitting pattern, or minimal raw commands.
3. Add `body` context to any strand another agent may pick up.
4. Run `strand ready` and pick from ready work, not the full list. Prefer a repo-curated
   ready query when one is registered: `strand ready --query <name>`.
5. Respect attribute conventions the repo's spools declare — for example, a ready strand
   carrying `hitl=true` means stop and ask the user before doing it. An op's `about`
   documents its conventions.
6. Complete one ready strand or one tightly related pair, then run relevant validation.
7. If new work is discovered, add and wire it before closing the current loop.
8. Close completed strands: `strand update <id> --state closed`.
9. Repeat `strand ready` until done or blocked.

## Workspaces

Without a flag, `strand` targets the repo's `.skein` world. Select another explicitly for
disposable or non-default worlds:

```sh
strand --workspace <dir> ready
strand --workspace <dir> update <id> --state closed
```

## Validation and finish

Before reporting success:

- `strand ready` matches the expected next work, or is empty because all planned
  work is closed.
- Completed strands are closed; newly discovered work is represented by active
  strands; dependencies reflect actual blocking relationships.
- Relevant checks pass.

Branching, delegation, review, and landing discipline are repo policy, not strand core: take
them from repo conventions and from the `about`/`prime` surfaces of the ops the repo
registers. Building on `.skein` itself — config, spools, the source docs — is covered by
`mill skein prime`; day-to-day tracking does not need it.
