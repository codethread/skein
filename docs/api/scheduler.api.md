# <a name="skein.api.scheduler.alpha">skein.api.scheduler.alpha</a>


Explicit-runtime API for the weaver-owned no-poller scheduler primitive.

  A weaver owns one durable clock trigger: trusted code persists a wake keyed
  by a stable caller key, an absolute instant, and a fully qualified handler
  symbol, and the runtime re-arms and dispatches it through the weaver's
  shared serialized async lane so clock-triggered handlers and post-commit
  event handlers observe one mutation order (RFC-009, DELTA-weaver-scheduler-
  repl-001). Delivery is at-least-once: handlers must be idempotent.

  This namespace validates the wake against the shared
  `:skein.core.specs/scheduler-wake` boundary spec (the persistence seam
  consults the same spec) and resolves handlers eagerly, so a bad wake or
  handler fails `schedule!`, not dispatch; durable storage lives in
  `skein.core.db`, and timer arming/dispatch in
  `skein.core.weaver.scheduler`. Persisted rows return as decoded
  data-first maps (`::pending-wake`, `::cancellation`).

  Pull-based `wake-at` strand attributes plus named queries remain the
  default answer when a poller already exists. Reach for this namespace only
  for the no-poller case where something must proactively happen at instant T
  with no client polling to trigger it.

  Callers own runtime selection and pass the target weaver runtime as the
  first argument to every function here; capture it with
  `skein.api.current.alpha/runtime` only at trusted entry points.




## <a name="skein.api.scheduler.alpha/cancel!">`cancel!`</a>
``` clojure
(cancel! runtime key)
```
Function.

Cancel a pending wake in `runtime` by stable key.

  Removes whichever generation currently holds `key` and returns the
  cancellation's history row as a decoded `::cancellation` map. A missing
  key fails loudly.

## <a name="skein.api.scheduler.alpha/pending">`pending`</a>
``` clojure
(pending runtime)
```
Function.

Return all pending wakes in `runtime` as decoded `::pending-wake` maps.

  Ordered by wake-at ascending with a stable key tie-break, so the earliest
  pending wake is `(first (pending runtime))`.

## <a name="skein.api.scheduler.alpha/schedule!">`schedule!`</a>
``` clojure
(schedule! runtime wake)
```
Function.

Persist or replace a durable wake in `runtime` and arm it for dispatch.

  `wake` is a map of :key (stable non-blank string), :wake-at
  (java.time.Instant), :handler (fully qualified symbol resolvable in
  `runtime`'s spool classloader), and optional :payload (nil or a map that
  encodes to a JSON object). Replacing an existing key resets its attempt
  count. Returns the persisted wake as a decoded `::pending-wake` map.
  Malformed keys/instants/payloads and unresolvable or non-callable handlers
  fail loudly; no wake is persisted on failure.
